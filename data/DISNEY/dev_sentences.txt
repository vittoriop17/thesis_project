The writers twisted and hacked the plot as much as possible.  
These dolls are within reach but you gotta do the extra work.
THEY ARE AWESOME!
I can watch this again and again and still get a laugh.
It's big and squishy, very cuddly and soft.  
He's quite suspicious of creatures who are different from them, and never really warms up to Tarzan until his last few breaths, when he finally calls him "my son."Jane
I can't help but love it.
Another movie that had to be replaced by a copy that had worn out.
Sorry I don't know the terms to use.  
well constructed toy from Disney.
It looks grungy and well loved, just as it should.  
Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.
This is a movie about all the best things in life: friendship, love and being naked.
I love it.
You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan* In Walt's Words; Why I Made Peter Pan* The Peter Pan That Almost Was*
The cast and screenplay are both on a very high level.  
I love cars.  
Mom and pop shops, everyone knows your name, people take pride in their business as well as town.
Great movie to add to your collection.
Good doll, good clothes.  
At any other level it is absolute nonsense.
i loved this as a child and like having it in my collectiionxxx
But in a film this light and frothy, you know that there's a happy ending on the horizon.
There's just something about Rushmore that speaks to you whether you relate to one of the characters, love Bill Murray, or have a thing for independent film.
bright colors, looks exactly as it does on the picture.
With an assembly of Charming Characters and Captivating Funny Lovable Creatures.
Wendover, Utah.
If you're looking to own Chicken Little, the Blu Ray is the way to go.
She is thrilled to have an Angus doll she can sleep with at night.
We thought this would be a great idea to get her used to the real vacuum since she was afraid of it.  
I remember going to see this several times with my parents in the theater and it never got old.  
Tis is one of the best movies I have ever seen and is life lessons for children of all ages.
MY THREE OLD LOVES TO PLAY DRESS UP.
Furthermore, not only the wheels, but also the entire back section of the toy, is made of a hard plastic...
arrived safely and was wrapped as part of the angel tree kid presents.
His feet move and his fingers are even moveable!
Pfeiffer is predictably good here, but I really wish she could have used this same passion in a more original or inspired film.
How brother bear relates to world religion in how the local tribesmen believe all creatures are created through the Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an aurora.
I'm always glad when I can shop on Amazon for anything it saves me time, gas, and delivery issues.
the disc is obviously clean but there are at least 5 skips in the movie, im mad about it, the quality should have been low i would not have purchased if it skipped i dont want my kids to scream at me every 10 minutes, thank you for the aggrivation
The documentary in particular stands out as it reunites the children of the animators as they reminisce on what it means to have been a Disney kid and how it impacts them in ways that continue to this day.
Ms. Piggy certainly has changed since her first appearance.  
Princess dresses are optional.
Until the movie was re-released, I still popped the VHS version from my childhood into my VCR at least once a month to get that warm, fuzzy feeling that only Disney can provide.
We purchased a bath mat, and this product and its awesome!
but I don't mind that much because the price is great.
Yes, I'd pick this one over many of today's movies.
The large size means she and a playmate can sit together to do it without crowding.
Her face is perfect, reflecting her personality wonderfully, her hair is long and wonderful!
I love how different of a personality each car has.
If you have a child or grandchild who is into this series, they will likely enjoy this doll.
My daughter LOVED this.
this platinum edition is just what i got.  
She is dressed just like she is in the movie
she opened it, said she loved it
The film degenerates into icky sexual innuendo, with the birdies billing and cooing in a sickening manner, the females "coming on" aggressively to the males (the opposite of what actually occurs), ** and mammals actually blushing over their entire bodies -- ignoring Mark Twain's famous observation.
FLOUNDER IS SO CUTE!!!!!!
My grandson begs to watch "the fish movie" when he's at our house because of the 3D glasses!!
It's great to see how certain characters like Miss Piggy developed in looks and personality over time.
It is just something easy to watch and it is always predictable that Bristow, Vaughn and others will always get out of all of those incredibly tight situations and although they appear to have sustained injuries (and some very serious) they look terrific afterwards!  
So I purchased this after she outgrew her Munchkin duck tub.
She figured out how to open and close it just fine.
It's got the mix of sadness and comedy all linked together with a great moral story line.
At times it has some serious issues but that is a very small part of this otherwise funny movie.  
Not much more to say
this  movie is one that needs to be added to your collection.  
so I guess you know what I'm thinking of and would rather not type all this stuff.
I just like this original piece just as it is.
This is my all time favorite Disney movie.
She was all over the place and it made washing & rinsing much harder.
Some characters graced us in the 'Jungle book', like Baloo, Shere Khan and Louis.
Feel like I got a little ripped off and wish I had researched it more before buying so be sure to double check prices elsewhere!
You just have to get past the fact that they are passing off a Hispanic as an Arab =)
Duckworth gets another moment in the spotlight when he coaches a baseball team in 'Take Me Out of the Ballgame.'All
Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox Legendary Heroes are two lesser known series from Walt Disney's TV show, but are just as entertaining as any of the more popular series from the era.
I also, several years ago, bought the book (non-fiction, by the way!)
Within minutes, we were in giggles as we acted out the roles of different Disney Princesses.  
In so happy that there are (some) female gendered sets to counter balance the landslide of male sets (chima, ninjago...) and especially glad to finally have male mini-dolls!!The build is nice and simple with some great new pieces or known pieces with new colours and nice stickers.
He is a year old now and still fits comfortably in it.
and I know every single song in it!!
Scrooge thinks he may have found a lost play by 'Drakespeare.'Disc 3 has some really good episodes.
The story is quirky and fun and I am a bit surprised at the 'R' rating as it does not reflect as an 'R' movie.
The Little Mermaid tells the story of Ariel who is bored with life under the sea and wants to know more about the human world.
It's a bit fragile, so we hate just dumping it in a toybox or something, but we can't stand it up on a shelf as it's very top-heavy and the feet don't support it as well.
Alan Menken lends his commentary on the creation of the music for the film.*
Because of their small size, they are very convenient for travel.
Prince Charming completes our collection.  
Michael is thrilled because Sydney offers him the middle drawer one evening while they're hanging out in her bedroom.
Great gift for the Little Princesses in our life.
Overall, great toy.
Maleficent is my favorite Disney villain.  
I somehow lost interest in Season 2 after the first few episodes, as it seemed like there wasn't enough differences from episode to episode.
It's awkward and touching when things get heavy and hilarious and lighthearted when things are more laid back.
You should be able to retract and expand them by pushing a button on the back of the figure, but that broke pretty quickly.  
These are cute their 3" tall and look like characters unlike some figures ive seen.  
I can't recommend this enough for your children.
Fortunately he didn't care much about broken up Buzz at that point and he went to toy heaven in the trash can.
We feel as if we have really spent the last hour and a half in the ocean, getting to know the characters, their personalities, and the lessons they must learn.
Well made product that will last a long time.
However, Sebastian & especially Scuttles (my favorite of the 2; the only good episode of the Little Mermaid show was the one with him in it) are 2 of the greatest sidekicks ever.  
While there, a messenger comes to the chieftain's son, Bulvine, seeking his assistance.
the missing film exists, the studio can make major bread by releasing a director's cut.  
Walt Disney TV Introduction (1954 & 1964) -
I am a bit embarrassed to say this, but this was my first time ever watching Monsters Inc all the way through.
It is a little grainy in dark scenes
but it still looks nice.
This kit is very cute and the instruments inside are cute but the bag itself is very hard and extremely difficult to open, even for an adult, let alone "little hands"!
the ladder is made of a flexible plastic.  
Relaxing, enjoyable, fun and tells a  meaningful story with great taste.  loved it a great deal.
The two men want peace between warring parties - and if conflicts continue they will help out the side that is for freedom and justice.  
WE HAD A HARD TIME GETTING THE DRESS OFF HER AT BEDTIME SHE WANTED TO SLEEP IN IT.
As a fan of stories set in history, a person who loves to learn all he can on Neanderthals, and as a reader of some, if not all, of Michael Crichton's early works, this movie was a must to own for me.  
Minnie and Daisy can also be a pain to stand up because they have heels on and have to stand almost at an angle.
No matter how old you get, you can continue to enjoy this Disney classic!
I should also mention - the pricing of this movie was marvelous.
This is a great movie, but then what movie isn't great when it has Johnny Depp it it.
I feel like a kid when I watch each episode and I laugh just as hard.
I would have given this move a one-star rating  based on this scene alone.
I liked and highly recommend it for all kids and disney fans.  
Lots of excitement and with 4 more seasons to go what else can they possibly dream up??
The middle brother, Denahi, sees Kenai's empty clothing and apparently assumes the bear ate him completely and now seeks revenge on the bear (Kenai).
She kept the toys she didn't want to float around there.
I'm still giving them 5 stars because they held up to my daughter's teeth.  
Great set of characters and a good story line as well.
They are very cute, durable, and are a large size.
I got this for my little girl, its an oldie, but a goodie
I find it somewhat annoying, but my boys love it, so yours likely will too.
DVD for kids and Blu-ray for adults to maintain.
Looks just like you would imagine Lotso to look in life.  
i saw a man who made a decision that didn't seem to matter that then spiraled out of control.
I have seen Pixar at their best with the Incredibles, Finding Nemo, Wall-E, and the Toy Story trilogy.  
If it says princess on the box my girls get excited.  
Ordered this one for our grand daughter...
The decals have almost all worn off after having them for only a couple of weeks.  
loved it granddaughters love watching this and they have it
I would recommend this product and seller to anyone.
Much fun for a boy who loves the Toy Story movies.
Rather than being the cartoon-style animals seen inSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the characters from Bambi were rendered after exhaustive study of live animals by the Disney animators.
Special effects were cheesy in some places but insanely spectacular in others (as it was intended).
The Velcro holds really well and the wallet is a great size for a little guy.
As for the blu-ray, the color saturation is sharper and more crisp, but it's still the same film.
Season One is the appetizer - Season Two is the entree.
'Magica's Shadow War' and 'Hotel Strangeduck' are some good Halloween specials.
That Russell Crowe didn't receive the Academy Award for it is a travesty of justice.
All kidding aside, it was the best decision they could have made at that time.  
but he's a perfect sized, very soft and lovable bear
This is a GREAT movie to watch with your family.
A great story in which you learn about loss, camaraderie and "twitterpation".
But it is not really that good.  
Through the years, the focus seemed to have turned inward onto family issues and relationships.
I liked the book and I've seen so many movies based off the story, but this to me is just a classic version.
I haven't sat through the entirety of Brother Bear 2 (as a rule, I dislike all of the cash-in sequels) but did want to check out the picture quality, and I have to say that it is gorgeous as well.
If we never close the lid again and the band-aid breaks she will still love it and it was well worth the money we spent and then some!
Good visuals, good story, good princess, but the reason we are all hear, is the songs!  
My grand daughter plays with it almost every day!  
Another good movie for the modern family to watch together as a whole family.  
It was done very tastefully and laughed and cried through the whole movie.
It's worth every penny.
I always liked this movie, but only recently purchased it for my 5 year old daughter - who closely resembles "Boo". :-)  
Whose minding the store now thatWalt is gone.
Animation Tests, Roughs, & Clean Up3.
Camera Move TestRelease and Reaction1.
It's wonderful:)
These are very cute little figurines... but they are smaller than I was expecting.  (They are about 3 1/2 " tall....
The jewels are also quite little and require good fine motor skills to place them into the plastic jewelry.
Spanish3) CaptionsSneak Peeks1) Cinderella2)
She was still shooting the arrows recently.
The special features are a little sparse, just some quick episode intros (which tend to include minor spoilers so best to not have them on for initial viewings) and a commentary on the four part "City of Stone."
The guests on this set of 4 disks include:Disc 1:Juliet ProwseConnie StevensJoel GreyRuth BuzziRita
My 3 year old begged us for this for Christmas so we looked and saw different versions.
I play it in my car for my kids or any person riding in the back seats, instant effect, I can see their faces of complete joy.
Work In Progress2.
I don't care who he gets angry with ("someone who cut off his acceptance speech.")  
The genre of animation has grown quite a bit in the last couple of decades.
It is certainly worth a watch, but I loved I enjoy having it on hand so that I can watch it whenever I want... and that tends to be about once a month.
Picking up where season 1 left off, this season continues the mythology of season 1 with all of the action.  
Belle agrees to live in the castle as the Beast prisoner in exchange for the release of her father.
It's held up very well!  
The story is gripping.
Good example of how life was like during the World Wars.
For example, Max sounds as if he is much older.
Some terrible whirlpool fight.  
The difference that I see with this seat, it is smaller, lower and sort of sits in the middle of the standard adult seat, whereas the others were larger and higher and overlapped the adult seat more - changing the positioning of the inside plastic lip that should deflect the pee and keep it in the bowl.
As most Pixar films do, it teaches life lessons on top of providing top quality entertainment for kids and adults alike.  
Tarzan has really made it up in the world and now that he has locations within the Disney parks, he really is a disney staple, fun movie and depending on the condition and price that you find it,  can really be worth having.
Disney is just totally amazing.
I love love love this!
I love Gargoyles, it is my favorite cartoon from when I was a kid.
As Bergman says to Crowe...something like "thanks for being a hero...they are dying breed."  
if the player guesses correctly she gets a jewel in her crown/bracelet/ring.  
The characters are great, and the plot is much better than most of the "classic" kids movies my daughter has recently seen.
And here, for the first time, are extracts of that filmed lecture, plus people remembering it and commenting on it and how it influenced their future thinking.
Her outfit looks like suede and is very well made.
The DVD arrived on time for Christmas and was priced fairly.
He plays with these every day.
It is easy for my granddaughter to move the arms and legs so that Prince Charming and Cinderella can dance together or sit down and have dinner in my granddaughter's play kitchen.
I will no doubt buy more DVD's from this seller.
Not only is the animation decent compared to the likes of other Disney DTV trash (Belle's Magical World **vomits**), but the plot, while not perfect, seems well thought out also.
Would have like to be given a different one that worked.
Slight Concern:*Small "gems" and "rings" are choking hazards for children less than three years old.
LOL  I purchased this widescreen DVD as a replacement for the two-disc combo set that I previously purchased.  
In the end I put them in bag and will use them for cake purposes only.
It was tedious and difficult to even sit through to the end.  
You will NOT regret this buy!
One of the best Disney movies as sea characters come to life singing and dancing creating an underworld of fun and colorful entertainment of sealife imagination.
We have never seen the movie, it was never a benefit to buy these expensive toys with a Disney trademark.
Its very helpful.
I have to admit this is probably my least favorite Ducktales set, and recommend people who want to relive seeing this show get Volume 2 first, as that has the awesome 5 part pilot on it, then if you like that get this one then Volume 3.
And boy...Christopher Plummer, the truly awful actor.
Finally got Peter Pan!  
The kids are fine with it, and the old version is only available on VHS.
We have a small shower stall.  
I think the reason is that I could identify with Bambi so much--he knows little more about anything going on than we the audience do--especially if we are very young children who don't even know about life, much less about life in the forest.
Seeing it again brought back old memories of the past
But it doesn't matter in the slightest because he is so incredible at it.  
(The bear just snaps together)
Don Hahn talks about the camera were going to be used and we get to see the first camera rehearsal during the dancing scene of the film.  
Nemo is great, his father Marlin was cool but my favorite by far was the absent-minded Dory.
I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released.
Her husband, who is the leader of the apes, refuses to allow her to consider Tarzan his son.
The quality of the movie is perfect.  
When we visited the ER shortly after Christmas after her sister had a fainting spell, she was able to identify some of the tools as the same ones in the ER!The tools are all built well, too, so I don't feel we'll have to worry much about any of them breaking.
If there were a desert island with a DVD player and a TV set -- and power -- this movie would be in my stack of DVD's to carry along.
My girl is a shorter than average, but still this mat is slightly too short for her.
I bought this to complete my collection!
What can you say about this Disney classic except that Disney Don't Make No Junk!
It's very rare in this era of "the birth family is the best place for children" that we get a movie that says "family means the people that love you"and that's why people hate this movie.
Made of plastic but seem well built.
She then encounters a rabbit, who is late for a VERY important date!!
My Great Grandsons most favorite buddy I think he gave me five stars for getting it for him.
Hopefully 3D isn't dying out like all the signs are pointing to.
Perfect as a gift for a fan of the show.
This is a great pre-teen/teenage movie.
Finding Nemo has always been a fun movie to watch.  
Wishing I had read more of the reviews before I purchased this for my niece.
With movies, I'm usually "one and done."
Instead we went to the disney store in August and bought two sets for my daughters birthday.
He is so in love with her from day one
This movie has a good story and is clean so the whole family can watch.  
i only got one of the disc
You just have to pull slightly and it will pull completely free.  
My autistic grandson loves this video.  
I have seen all the movies and they just keep you interested because story line changes enough to make it a great movie and keep you interested even though the characters are the same.

Im a kid at heart.
She likes to give them water to drink.
The magic of a good story to be shared over and over.
When humans come to the jungle he has conflicted feelings.
The costumes are fairly resilient and have stood up to the first month of heavy use fairly well.
Brings back the joys of my 1950s childhood.  
She loves the princesses and Dream Castle so this was an awesome gift to go with her set.
Very thoughtful movie and super well done.
If you haven't seen it or don't own it on Blu-Ray yet, you should.
The pillow is not puffy enough.  
Derek shields Xanatos from an attack and is infected by the Mutate serum.  A16.  
My grand-daughter loves it and will sit and watch it over and over.
I love this show for the stupidity of it.

Recommended!If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me.
It's not the best of the classic Disney titles, but is worthy of being in any collection.
Now, this precious movie is available in a fantastic Blu-ray plus DVD edition.
Unfortunately, the advertised DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix must be proactively selected.

When I was young, I loved many of the Disney Afternoon cartoons, Ducktales being my favorite.  
I do NOT like this tub!!!!!  
This Disney Plush Chameleon is enjoyable for the kids.
The grandkids really liked this one.
The story itself is kid-friendly: an obnoxious egotist discovers the value of having friends.
As with most Disney movies now a days they have something for all ages not just the kids!
It is interesting as well as entertaining!
Composing a Classic - (20:18) A Magical conversation with Alan Menkin, Don Hahn and Menkin's agent Richard Kraft.  
Also shows some live action footage from Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.
This movie although several years old is still timely and relevant today.  
After school was over I would come running home to watch the Disney Afternoon.
We love this movie and this set is great.
My granddaughter loves all the Disney princesses and she loves dressing up like them.
Another source of humor occurs when Mr. Smith first arrives in town, from his train trip.  
So bright, so sharp, so...perfect!
Strength of Character2.
The voice actors for this movie were very good.  
I did use them on top of cake and that worked out perfectly.
SPECIAL FEATURES:"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition" come with the following special features:Storybook App - An app for your children to access coloring pages, puzzles, music, memory games and more.
This one started out to suggest that Jane would go and Tarzan would stay.
I feel my money was well spent.
The main plotline--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.
If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD.
Even seeing the measurements in the details before I ordered it, I didn't realize just how huge it would be in person.
I love this movie - it is one of my favorite Disney animated movies.  
Very satisfied with my purchase.
Alwaysys keeps kids happy and quiet.
I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie, but I'm not one of them.
This one keeps my child busy as she is obsessed with Sofia and her family.
Are they insane?  
"An Elephant Never Suspects" has a big shortage of peanuts for the Elephants at the zoo as the Rescue Rangers are accused of robbing them as they must try to clear their names and Alan Oppenheimer (He-Man/Bravestarr/She-Ra fame) guest stars and finally "A Case of Stageblight" features a talented alligator living under an operahouse who wants to do anything to be a star.
It was Margaret Kerry and not Marilyn Monroe who was the model for Tinker Bell.
My daughter loves Buzz more than Woody but he still get a lot of play time.
Amazing how it can creep into you vocabulary.  
Works well as expected, thanks very much!
With that being said, if one was to ask me how I rank "Alice in Wonderland", I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline, while a good and fun family film at times, because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative, it's not a film that I can easily compare to a "Snow White", "Pinocchio" or "Dumbo".  
This is a great change from all the Disney princess plush dolls we have in the house.  
Tigger loses faith in his bouncing ability, even submitting to certain death when he feels he can't bounce to safety.
There are some "scary" scenes at the beginning and our 3-1/2 year old "jumped" at first....but, then the 2nd and 3rd time she watched it...
AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"Peter Pan: Diamond Edition" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD High Resolution Audio and also French and Spanish Dolby Digital  Language Tracks.  
Also a bit long for us.
kids movie - they like it.  
What type of berry I'm not sure, but he smells good.
As Father's Day approaches, I write my review of this fantastically crafted animated feature from Pixar--a very lifelike and original tale that can easily make a viewer forget he
Unforgettable characters and amazing animation scenes.
The songs are a joy to see performed and the plot is excellant.  
I would also like some extra features, maybe have Sharif come on camera to apologize as well(I wish you would have STAYED retired)!
And the general "clean-up" of the image adds to one's appreciation of the art and animation, rather than looking "sterile" (as it does in "Pinocchio").The liner notes describe this and other Disney Blu-ray films as "Digitally restored beyond their original brilliance".
But the carefully nuanced portrayal of those who are pitched into parting with their values, piece by piece, and end up losing everything is a masterpiece.
It was suggested I check amazon.
Even if your adapter doesn't fit, just do your best to choose one closest to the size of the hole and use your fingers to prevent any air leaks.
So it didn't break off at the weakest point, it broke off to where there is a hole in her body where her neck used to go.
It is a film without any notable dud elements.
You need to see this.
Yes, I know that Critchten produced this movie.
There are a handful of Disney movies that slip through the cracks when people discuss the great animated films of the Mouse House.
Like the fact that it also comes with a DVD so we can watch it in the car or on our laptop, if we want to.
This is movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it.
Solid Blu-ray transfer all the way.
This set is great.
It was fun to watch the actors related to each other.
Thank goodness it is one of those movies that never gets old :)  
Brother Bear touches on so many different levels that i feel is great for kids.
My daughter got this for Christmas, because she loves Doc Mcstuffins and she likes to pretend she's a doctor.
It fits his crib mattress perfectly.  
There are 10 in the collection so far, and I have purchased 5 for our daughter.  
I would like to say that is a film suitable for children of all ages but the truth is there are some really disturbing images.
Belle was okay with who she was and didn't want to fit in, and I think her personality is inspiring to women across the world.
and you got to love the blue-ray picture!
Kiss the Girl - Ashley Tisdale Music Video* Disney Song Selection*
I cleaned it and washed it carefully and still it skipped ahead.
George of the Jungle 2 is the 2003 Disney direct-to-DVD sequel to the hilarious 1998 orginal and based on the classic 1960's animated cartoon series.
My daughter, two and a half years old,  who loves all things Minnie Mouse loved the bracelets.  
It's the only adaptation, as far as I'm concerned, that correctly portrays the childish innocence from the Lewis Carroll books, along side the adult brilliance in the characters, "morals", and possibly herb-induced inspirations.  
The animators even intentionally created a contrast between Kenai the human and Kenai the bear by changing the brightness, art style (more cartoony as the bear) and even the aspect ratio of the film.
We used C.R. Gibson calendars for all of our children.
HOW TO TAME YOUR DRAGON---the son of a Viking chief is a misfit, living in a village harassed by dragons.
There are more books and audio CD's on Amazon for the Hitchhiker's but if you're not sure you like them....watch this and you'll be hooked!  highly recommend.
The stories build on each other and the backstory is filled in on many key characters introduced in the first season.
and i figured he waited long enough.  
We purchased Miracle at Midnight to go with our unit on Number the Stars.  
The Hunchback of Notre Dame IIIV.
The picture quality has obviously been improved with the new release which makes it all the more enjoyable.  
It will be there before you expect it.
I regret spending my precious dollars on this program.
It's almost lacking in content for kids and adults, and most of it is bland and boring.
maybe I provided some thoughts or insight for people on the fence about this movie even if I am almost a decade too late!
It's there, don't get me wrong, but at no point in Nemo did I feel like I could almost reach out and grab something like I did with the Chinese Lanterns in Tangled.  
I got this for a friend who picked it out for herself after looking at lots of different baby books.
this is a Christmas gift for my sister, she and I have loved this movie, since we where kids back in the good old days and to see it on Blu-ray 3d would be nice on Christmas  day .
Even when it was in the dead of summer we would watch this.
In the original, a careless boy named Kenai is magically changed into a bear in post-Ice Age North America.
Flounder and Sabastian are adorable.  
Moving on, Time Capsule examines the era in history where "Bambi" found its way into the hearts of millions around the world and provided audiences with an easy momentary escape from the fears and troubles of World War II.  
They hear the dentist say that he plans to give the clown fish (i.e., Nemo) to his niece.
I did was it
This movie is a true classic!  
my daughter love Monsters Inc and Monsters University.  
Don't float!I bought these toys to accompany the Pirate Ship bath toy that I'd bought previously.  
The doll and the lambie plush smelled of this glue.  
I love it, it shipped quickly and it was what was promised.
The cons first: 1) He is hard to balance and stand upright because of his heavy laser gun and the flimsy little wheels beneath his robe.  
It's no use pretending that this is for grandchildren or younger guests -- nope, it's for us old-timers!
my daughter loves it.  
the movie works and it does pause for a min or so
This item comes with batteries, and there is no off button so if you want to test it when you receive be prepared to listen to it for over 20 minutes or turn the volume knob all the way down.  
But the worst part is the dress is already ripped on the back.
From talking flowers that cannot guess her name, to cookies that make you grow and shrink, and to a Caterpillar that does hallucinogenics and wants to know who she is.
Another interesting fact about the movie is that the hunters/humans themselves, portrayed as the villains in this piece, are only seen in shadow.
Video was good, but the sound from Amazon isn't that great.
Anyone who watched Disney will remember Recess and all of the lessons taught.
My friends also tell me this may even be pushed back 2 or 3 more weeks if it's decided by marketing that will spur more holiday purchases.
Meanwhile, The Punisher promises Anna Watson that he will find Mary Jane, and top of his list of suspects is...Peter Parker?!  
Clean up is easy as I just take a wet paper towel and wipe clean.
However, all the adults enjoyed it, and we played it most of Christmas day.  
If there was any major fault of the film, it's how various people were portrayed.  
It's hilarious and introspective.
All these shows are in great detail and there are no shortcuts or trimmings.
It is so much better than Finding Nemo and some other she like to watch.
Brings back fun memories.
Luckily my 4 year old doesn't mind.
Thru the Mirror Mickey Mouse Animated Short (Now in Hi-Def)*
Any Disney video is the best
This release is far inferior to the Sleeping Beauty release.  
My girls watched this when they were children.  
They are very small, and come with a removable tiara and tiny hair brush.
I've read before about parents of little wolves being killed.
The clothing was what I expected for doll clothes and the painting on the doll was fine.
I washed that gunk out of her hair and let it be free flowing.  
The second is a HUGE deal to me-there is NO BUZZ LIGHTYEAR IN THIS SET!
No return hassle free.
Its always different and she is learning her colors and working on her memory without her even knowing it.
This is a great and hilarious movie adaptation of the phenomenal TV show.
The boots are very cool, I must say, his whole outfit is so very authentic, and I especially love his sash with the crown in it, and the matching one for Ella, she adored that!  
The rare collection of true rarities certainly makes up for the sets shortcomings.
The doll is very pretty.
I've compared the Blu-ray high definition restoration with the regular DVD version and there is really no comparison.
I turned it off after 30 minutes.
We all want them to be successful.
And then I'll look up the graphic novels.
Blue rays are hard to damage, great for the longevity and quality of picture.
I recently bought a used Chicken Little movie and it had a cheap flimsy case wirh a frame backing covered over with transparent material.
This is the perfect episode to end the set on.  
Then, of course, the symbolism found in characters like the stuck-up, in-crowdy flower patch, the beatnik caterpillar and the Queen of Hearts are so easy to decypher as to be laughable.
I've been on the hunt for these plush Elsa dolls from Disney, yet, their allowing these prices?
It is one of my most favorite movies of all time.
The music has one volume setting, and that is LOUD!My daughter's fingers aren't strong enough to press the button to open the hidden compartment.
"Monsters, Inc.", while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.
Storyline was ok but got a little boring for me.
I got this from Disney.com a somewhat year ago and was very saddened i had even spent a dime on it.
Set Up2) Audio Optionsa.
A verbal explanation there.
No more black bars on the top and bottom of the picture.
Despite Disney having very little competition in the way of animation studios at the time it's clear that they challenged themselves to produce some of the most stunning visuals ever.
Bought for Xmas.
My daughter likes it.
Still plays with it a year later.  
I fully recommend it to kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, even pets.
throughout the film (my son and I have started saying it ourselves), and the phrase "keep a weather eye on the horizon".
Likewise, the philosophy behind Gaston makes him a very interesting villain.  
Kanai is able to understand all the animals and they all talk like modern day American's.
I bought this for my son's 4th birthday.
Arrested for heroin abuse, Will loses his job as a reporter and is forced to undergo recovery therapy.
He's always good for a chuckle.
I was so pumped for an epic sea battle.  
Every criterion by which we judge movies (cinematography, score, characterization, plot, etc.) is flawless.  
I watched each of Disney's animated theatrical releases in order over the past 6 or 8 months and it feels a little strange tching a fully CGI animated film produced by the studio.
He becomes more caring, solicitous, and gentlemanly.  
Fun one to watch over and over.  
Over the past years I've seen and loved every Pixar film.
Having suffered through the horrid singing littered through `Pocahontas' for the past month, I was happy to hear the voice of Phil Collins fill my eardrums as opposed to a group of actors who can't carry a tune (although I have heard Minnie Driver sing, and she has a great voice).Beware of certain scares here, and know your kids before you let them watch (the opening sequence made my daughter cry, so if your kids are very family oriented you may not want them to watch this).  
This was also the debut of Bill Murray's indie comedy career as Mr. Blume: the man cursed with "Child in Man's body" syndrome.
I took this thing apart multiple times to mess with it.
Print: nice and brightMaterial: shiny, but not thick and comfortable.
They come upon sea turtles, sharks, jellyfish, and more, on their travels.
My 2 year old granddaughter loves it.  
I highly recommend "The Insider" as it is not a simple film by any means, it requires you to think.
Because she is so tall (80th percentile), the skirts are short on her (above the knees).
Everything you wanted to know about the music from "Beauty and the Beast".
I gave it to my 3 year old granddaughter and put away the DR.
This is a wonderful addition to your Disney library of DVD's for those rainy days.  
In all, I think it's worth adding to a classic Disney home collection.  
This Walt Disney movie hits the nail right on the chew toy, as Dachshunds are very mischievous, & Great Danes love to be a part of the pack, & are truly lap dogs, as they really don't realize how big they are.
So what if your box doesn't close all the way?
The most natural "intense guy" actor I've ever seen.
When Disney did the HD transfer for Little Mermaid, they swapped two shots during "Part of Your World" and has yet to issue a recall or replacement program that addresses the issue.  
My son loves this toy.
I watched it and thought Disney's use of 3d actually made me see things I never paid attention to before.
All of them looked cheap and I didn't want to buy it until I saw this one.
I hesitated originally because both 1 & 2 were probably just tiresome kids again.  
We have a young, [seemingly] helpless girl.
Their were too many special effects and not enough story.  
They do not sell this toy locally and after cleaning out a good portion of his old toys for a garage sale, we are slowing replacing them with newer ones.  
I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.
I think I will read the book now.
Cards that say "any purple" or "any sea star" I have to help her with.  
That means multiple stops and more gas.
Well, neither do the books.
Woody is exactly what we wanted, as if he was pulled straight from Toy Story the movie.
It is the first floor puzzle we found for Minnie Mouse.  
It's just a nice doll for a toddler/little girl.
The colors really pop and there is hardly any graininess.  
I loved it as a kid, and I was thrilled that I enjoy just as much as an adult if not even more.
I thought that it was well done.  
Ran it through my CD clinic a few times and it looked better.
Pros:  Includes all the main characters from the show.  
Whereas visual artists such as Hieronymus Bosch reflected their visions of the other-world in paintings, Lewis Carroll's palette was paper and words.
So what about Jiminy Cricket and the ventriloquist?
My 3 1/2 year old son takes it to school sometimes, and to show and tell.  
Make sure to grab this to share with your future generations.
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter....she loves it!
Bought each season separately because it was cheaper.
The only reason why I gave this 4 stars- is because they left a lot open-ended.  
Same idea as the rest,...thought we were getting a good deal and should have known.
I AM INTO HISTORICAL MOVIES AND COMEDY MOVIES A LOT.
Also for watching it with my kids I like the emphasis on friends and cultivating strong relationships and learning to lean on one another.  
A very good value item.
I like this movie very much.  
Take the scene for example, when Pinocchio is running home and stumbles into Honest John and Gideon for a second time: the Fox and the Cat, pretending to be his friends, see an "illness" in the puppet that ultimately leads to the conclusion that he needs a vacation on Pleasure Island, "where every day is a holiday."
There are a few deja vu moments in the film.
At least its oneof the few where an animal/person doesn't die, which is a good thing
My 5 yr old doesnt leave it out of her sight!
The special features includes a 1968 Oscar-winning Pooh cartoon "The Blustery Day" and an interactive game.
These are cute and my daughter loves them.  
Cute set of shoes.
I already have this movie and bought it for my future daughter-in-law.
It happily doesn't drag on the ground for her, but just skims the top of her shoes.
Overall, it's a cute set for a Sofia The First fan, but not a must have set by any means.
Well I remember watching this as a child..
Now about the movie- some of the scenes may get a little creepy for children but they serve to warn them about the consequences for being dishonest or naughty.
It was pricey too.
Disney did it again; How did they -AGAIN- persue me to buy a well-known film AGAIN that I already owned on Blu-ray ?
A must for any fan of the series, one of the best cartoons I feel was ever made everyone should at least check it out somehow if not making a purchase
I also looked at local Disney stores and JC Penny stores in their Disney departments and they could never keep this item on their shelves.  
This is pretty interesting.
If I had to give an overall rating of the three Pirates of the Caribbean films in one sentence each it would be1) "Curse of the Black Pearl" a brilliant, entertaining romp based on the original Disney story and rides - Five stars2) "Dead Man's Chest," the first half of the sequel: often insane but frequently entertaining -
Very happy about the quality of this item!
It.......wow.
It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this.  
( I REMEMBER WATCHING THEIR TESTMONY ON TELEVISION)  
She even has bendable joins (her ankles move too!).
This movie just touches your heart.
this is a great children to watch with the kids and would tell others about the disney movie and my family enjoy the movie
He barely plays it with now.
Based on the notebook of the Arab, I thought this was very well done.
The actual hand-drawn animation looks great, and it's obvious the lengths that Disney's animators went to to properly emulate human emotion and movement - one of the extras goes into detail about all of the live action footage that was shot for reference.
Beauty and the Beast has become a classic Disney film.
New characters join in the fun.
Seller for very prompt with shipping.
I really can't think why anyone would care that there are black bars on the sides, but apparently, Disney does.
A must have.
It gets two thumbs up from me.
Belle was a great heroine, she was smart, cute, and followed the old saying, "You can't judge a book by it's cover."
my kids likes it.
I give the bonus feature department  a sold 2 stars as the bonus features are not many and could be improved on greatly.
I also agree with other reviewers about a few things:~ Short microphone cord~ Weak microphone - have to put mouth on it for it to pick up voice~ Voice heard when buttons are pressed sounds like she has an accent almost robotic sounding.  
A wonderful adventure for both Nemo and his dad, well acted and sometimes stunning animation.
Some of the gags are preposterous, and the `let's learn a lesson' ending is totally wasted on the remainder of the film (let's be honest, this film wasn't made to `make a difference') but the overall effect of the film is one of enjoyment.  
I also bought the Kindle book.
If you are only after some nostalgia, the 3rd volume probably gives you the best amount of 'Duck Power' for your dollar.
So the cold rainy Vancover weather insured Connor of plenty of human company in his toasty tent !
And yes there are balls.
"The Carpet Snatchers" deals with Professor Nimul returning as he makes special technological magic carpets to do crimes for him, followed up by "Piratsy Under the Sea" where our heroes end up in a garbage truck on the sea by accident when they stumble upon a group of pirate mice for they must get back home.
It used to take a few minutes to transfer the movie to iTunes, now it takes hours.
So much fun; so much unexpected irony.  
No resemblance to the little statue in Copenhagen's harbor, but a great tale and one of Disney's best, I think.
Without seeing all the pieces my daughter would ask about some random item (e.g. where's the treasure chest, Peter Pan's dagger, etc.)
Disney did a pretty excellent job with the Audio quality but when it come's to the picture you'll find that it has really good colors and you can see the difference between a SD and a HD except it's not in either wide screen or full screen ?!!
The rest of the shorts on disc one are of varying quality too.
Good Movie for the young at heart.
Anne did not have a huge role but an important one.  
but they will not do this puzzle.  
I just love this movie, it's so funny and one of my favorite actors is in it.
Sometimes you need a comedy that, in all honesty, doesn't make you explain the humor to someone you are watching it with b/c it went over their head.  
Now we know from the scene before that Honest John and Gideon are just in it for the money, but since they are corrupt and greedy, they help out the Coachman anyway, providing him with slaves in the forms of small boys.
Some of the characters, Daisy and Donald mostly, don't like to stand.  
The characters are drawn from more than Norse sources....several Celts appear as well.  
I love the british humor and all of the characters.  
it's fun for everyone in the family, nothing scary and nothing to give the little ones nightmares
In addition to this, there's alsoEloise at the Plaza, and both are wonderful adaptations of the stories, though this is our favorite.
The paint is chipping off on the edges of the pieces after less than a month's use.
Baloo and Kit are close friends with Wildcat, and Rebecca's daughter Molly.
From the very start it had rude and fowl language.
While practically every cartoon character ever created has, at one time or another, saved Christmas, there are precious few animated specials or direct-to-videos with a springtime, Easter or even an Easter Bunny.
What is the point and I felt misleading.
I had never seen the movie, but have recently become slightly obsessed with the Disney live action movies of the late 50's-early 70's.
DVD ia Good condition!
DreamWorks answered with their own underwater adventure a couple years later in Shark Tale, Weinstein Company's The Reef would follow suit two years after that and even 20th Century Fox wanted in on the action with 2010's The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer.  
They hold up well with my energetic 5 year old!  
Warning: Don't buy this Blue Ray!
It is classy and fun.  
Horse Sense:  Webby helps trains a horse for the Kenducky Derby so the owner will have the money to raise it.  
I use this as a entrance rug to my bathroom.
Despite superficial plot similarities to Toy Story (especially in the climactic dimensional door pursuit - yes, a potential Disney theme ride) and yes, even a smidgen of "King Kong), "Monsters, Inc." stands on its own as a fascinating, well-rendered, multi-faceted piece of work.
Not a great smelling soap either.
Garner, Garber, Olin and Rifkin are especially good, although the talents of Carl Lumbly, Bradley Cooper, and Kevin Weisman should not be overlooked.
Good for her.  
I understand there are some very hardcore sci fi fans that rave about this movie...
Of all the Disney Classics on Blu-ray (I own them all.), Beauty and the Beast and Lion King are the crowning achievements of Disney's HD restorations.
The villain Clayton and Jane's silly professor of a father are interesting.
They should anyways, as Gargoyles is one of the single greatest animated series ever.14.  
To ships which were that tough and well armed, the average pirate vessel simply was not a serious threat.
This is actually the car that started our grandson's "singles" collection.  
The video quality and sound are excellent and the extras are surprisingly entertaining.
It is grade A garbage.
A devastating movie that carves in relief the reality behind the screen.
His chances look slim until fate brings Belle into his life.
The DVD features an introduction by Diane Disney Miller and also includes the enhance edition of "Walt's Story Meetings" and DisneyPEdia: Bambi's Forest Friends.  
Overall, this was a fun game for any budding princess!
I will edit review if it falls apart.
They sat and laughed through it and asked to watch it again the next day.
Guilty:  Tombstone, whilst incarcerated in Rooker's Island, plots revenge on Robbie Robertson as Robbie previously caused his arrest.
My kids love it, and since I do daycare, I ordered it for one of my daycare kids for Christmas, as he would always pick this out when it was his turn to pick the "quiet time" movie.
I'm definitely not as in to the film itself as I was as a small child, but it's definitely watchable and interesting to see the artistry after all these years.
Regardless, this movie is so wonderful.
"Tarzan" a Visually Stunning Full-Lenth Animated Feature Film from Disney.
B39.  Kingdom:  While Brooklyn struggles to assert his authority in the wake of Goliath's mysterious disappearance, Fang conspires to rule over his fellow Mutates in the Labyrinth.  
Rutt and Took, having fallen out, reform their brotherhood in front of Koda, prompting him to go after Kenai.
Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie series.
Extra bonus of small pieces-they store easier (unless they toy iare poorly made, then they will all fall apart when stored with other, better quality toys).
On the story is journalist Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who (against his ethical code) becomes personally involved with Wigand and as such gets drawn even deeper into the business intrigue.
so I guess I'm happy.
DVD Sep. 20)The Fox and the Hound: 30th Anniversary (on BD and DVD Aug. 9)Closing Thoughts:Cars is an excellent film that is worth watching.
I adored this movie as a child too.
Cons, a difficult to believe romance between stars I found irritating (it seemed like they were going for a Han Solo kinda thing with Gould's character, but it just wasn't working for me, nothing against him), a story that felt a little anticlimactic and had some holes, and an absolutely horrendous theme song.
The stars include Ruth Buzzi, Connie Stevens, Joel Grey, Juliette Prowse.  
This Red die cast vehicle is a bit larger than the average die cast car...
It's in great condition, and I'm thrilled to have added it to my movie collection!
They don't fit well on the ship.
The DVD-only edition won't have the same amount of bonus features as the BD.PD: Some ads promoting Disney new releases look very exciting including:Tangled (in theaters Nov. 24)Toy
Everything is soft.
One evening Ariel rescues Prince Eric from drowning and brings him to shore.
While viewing the movie, see additional visual material and hear re-created storyboard meetings that let you hear about the inspirations for characters, scenes, and the music.
In real life, Man's principal bad influences on wildlife have been the wholesale killing of predators and the destruction of habitat -- not the wanton murder of poor, innocent deer mommies.
I always wanted to see this episode back on TV (since clips from it played during my favorite of the intros) & was glad when I caught it one day, & it's still one of my favorite episodes.  
It shows clips from Mickey Mouse cartoons and Disney films like "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", "Song of the South" (Uncle Remus!), and, you guessed it, the soon-to-be-released "Alice in Wonderland".  
So I went to Amazon.com
Each character in this movie has a unique personality, especially Dory  (played by Ellen DeGeneres).  
I may not be one of the biggest Pixar fans in the world, but I know a good movie when I see one.
The sound is vibrant as you really feel like you are on a race track or driving down a highway.  
And although the picture on this Blu-ray doesn't stink, it's not perfect.
Our 2 year old baby love it.
so i cant wait for 3d blu ray.
I was surprised to actually see Angus T. Jones from "Two and a Half Men" play George's son, he did a fine job.
This is a movie that in my mind is an instant classic!
i hate this movie and the cricket gave me nightmares as a child but it is classic disney and i am making a collection forget letting your kids watch this
Good quality as well.
My wife is a Dachshund fanatic so when I found this movie I purchased it for her.  
My son is over the moon about getting Zurg as a gift!  
This is one they sure as hell don't make anymore.  
legendary captain  hook can never get pan.  if you never seen this film watch it.  
you would have too be high to enjoy this flick
Love that character, she makes the movie!
Have a good day.  
I just had this feeling that `Quiz Show' was going to be a complete bore.  
Whoever put Disc 2 together must not have had it all there.
Like the past few Treasures sets, this one suffers from lack of restoration and care on some of the shorts.
Bambi, the title character, is actually the least amusing character in the movie, but he is surrounded by lots of vast loveable characters, especially in Thumper the rabbit, and of course Flower the skunk which befriend him in the Disney forest.
If you remember Season one there were a core group of characters, with season 2, they have introduced different people to move the story in a different direction still utilizing the same effects and storylines.  
They absolutely love it!  
its a great Family movie or a movie can be watch or alone ether way it a great movie to be grown in a different  way but to share the same things in life as other  its a great movie a must watch
May it be Alice trying to get use to her changing sizes or her encounter with the Red Queen.
Not for money, our retirement fund, or bragging rights.  
The pieces are large and perfect for little kids.
This is an excellent movie and it is based on the book written by Michael Crichton titled Eaters of the Dead.
The narrator has been described as scary or creepy, but I disagree.
Sydney's clueless coworkers at SD-6, her intelligent but dangerous father, even the CIA's therapist has a few quirks.
bring back memories when you watch Disney channel or carton network as chip n dale fight fat cat this is like duck tails tailspin dark wing duck goof troop all in one also like Micky mouse house of mouse
kids who grew up in the 90's will really appreciate this movie.
I also love how it was 2 disc limited edition for so cheap as well :)
It was also amazing to see how different it behaved at play.
The zany screwball humor was good.
Always good stories.
It was a good movie story wise the quality was great.
Jane is really cute, with a great British accent, and Tarzan is a sharp chinned muscle man.
Comedy is so subjective.
BUT THE ONE I RECEIVED HAS A MATURE FACE.
As of this writing, they are still selling it for that price.
Step aboard the Submarine Voyage, both old and new, one of the most beloved attractions in Disneyland's ever-evolving Tomorrowland.
I was bored one night, so I thought I'd give the movie a try.
The environment doesn't really change because it is inherent of Mary Blair's influence, while talented it is overly dependent on her skill.
Really enjoyed the animation as well.
i think perfect for pictures.
This naimation film is also drawn well and the story is basically on how the process of a young beautiful princess could change the ugly lookingbeast into a handsome beautiful prince that is also to say that under certain situations a person character may change in the end
The movie worked perfectly.
He's white so I imagine he is going to get dirty.  
I'm glad I got a hold of this.
My daughter bent a piece trying to take the puzzle apart.  
She was excited to play with them.  
The granddaughters loved it (ages 6 and 8).  
We love this movie.
He is really top heavy and usually falls over, but my son only carries them away so it's not an issue for him.  
Happy I did.
As a screenplay, it's brilliantly done; the performances are letter-perfect; and the evocation of 1950's New York could not be more on the money.
I love it !
They are rigid  and fairly hard.  
Of particular interest to me is the degree to which this is actually Howard Ashman's film.  
My only issues with it are the bow and arrow are pretty small.
but oh well....  
A sensitive, charming and engaging film about women discovering another aspect of their femininity.
the answer is on the back of the card, but can only be read using a red decoder jewel.  
No extras either, despite Disney devoting an episode of his Disneyland TV show to its production that could easily have been included.
What really makes this solid film into a 5-star experience, though, is the acting of Pacino.  
There's an interactive game menu after the movie.
For comparison, listen to Alec Wilder's boringly academic settings for the otherwise delightful readings of the books by Cyril Ritchard.
I liked it, my son (who was about 12 months when we bought this) DID NOT like this tub.  
Although it was a big hit and she loves it, it's made out of cheap plastic and seems like it would break too easily.
Helen Mirren and a great British cast - oh and one Irish hunk who was also in Political Animals in the U.S. - all photographed beautifully.  
It's a good, cheap product but not perfect for us.
Comparing them with episodes on You Tube, I noticed that shows I recorded are truncated for commercials.
Well, you just  have to wonder when they are going to do another movie with the same actors everyone fit their parts perfectly!
The material is top notch, and it's very well put together.  
If you love Peter Pan like I do (very nostalgic great memories) than this is a definite pickup/upgrade.
The alpha male doesn't like him, but allows his foster mother to keep him mostly because she reassures him that his human parents have been taken by the leopard.
I could really see Rob Petrie trying to play a character like this, and doing a great job (unlike the time he got a small role, tried to kiss a girl who wasn't Laura, and failed miserably).So with this movie, we had a lot of the physical comedy that made "The Dick Van Dyke Show" so wonderful.
but they have a version made by what seems to be the exact same manufacturer (just missing a few minor accessories) for eight bucks at j c penny right now.  
Third Man on the Mountain is a top classic Disney movie filmed on location in Zermatt, Switzerland but.......the Picture quality is not the best, just OK.Also big minus is: the DVD contains no bonus features which would be interesting (info about the real story, Making of etc.).Nice camaeo appearance by James MacArthurs real mother :
KA-CHOW!!!
(I'm not bothered by her brief song about not taking her own advice.
So this game is a clever riff off of that plot point combining treasure seeking into essentially a matching game that's sure to be fun for both boys and girls and their parents.
Even with state-of-the-art CGI, they never forget that the story is what people care about and i Finding Nemo /i is the best story Pixar has ever told, and the best story the animated world has yet to see.
If you like a scrappy duck called Donald and Huey, Dewy and Louie, your in for a treat!
I love how the toy had the authenticity seal on it too.  
The player with the next birthday goes first.
Worth watching this movie, if only for Ellen.  
My son loves this set.
Absolutely love this movie.
He also really likes the cars movies.
In the end Kerchack is killed by Clayton shotgun while trying to save Tarzan and Clayton dies accidently by hanging when Tarzan traps him in the vines.
She will have loots of fun playing with it.
in that case the player pretends to be the princess in question and the others guess who it is for a jewel.  
She has had Beauty for almost 4 months now, and it is still in excellent condition, attesting to its durability.
The sweet story, Fun, Nice andClear Picture.
Unscrupulous mayor wrecks machine, which goes totally out of control and starts to destroy village.
You got the stupid premise of a fish looking for his son and having to travel a long way to find him and the rest is way to predictable - even if we never made it through to the end.
Characters that were originally 2 pieces have very visible lines where they stick together.
Smith takes a train to a remote town, and is further transported to his base, located on the edge of a large frozen lake, by way of a small airplane.  
Recently the released the second part to this season, which of course, I bought!
, it looks beautiful and the 3D version is awesome.
Worth the time and money to get it.
Having never heard of this movie before, and being a fan of Keenen Wayans and the Wayans Brothers, I definitely had to watch this film ASAP.
All the main characters were well designed and the voices were well matched.
Holding up so far, the hair isn't a big frizzy mess like some dolls.  
Perfect for travel.
So I watched with perhaps a bit of a jaded eye, and just didn't quite enjoy this one.
The shows are a bit short, follows the same formula over and over.
A disney classic.  
I watch this movie with my daughter.
It's easy to put on also.
It's so wholesome in such a filthy word full of pornography and guts and gore.  
When you see icons show up, you have eight seconds to click on it and if you do, you access sub-featurettes.  
So really glad I get to keep this classic that I've watched since I was too small to remember, and share it with my young cousins when we are all at my grandparents place.
(Not to mention minnie curtains, minnie wall stickers and about 8 minnie plushies.)
While not one of my personal favorites, it is a fantastic entry in Disney's impressive film cannon.
The incredible wealth that is displayed - with the Princess being given drawers and drawers of jewels, and rooms full of clothes and shoes, also didn't feel quite as whimsical or fun this time around, with the world in the midst of a recession.
The case was dirty and the dvd was scratched up.
She absolutely loves all of the characters.  
She derides Lightning throughout the film by giving him an unkind nickname.
Cons:Quality isn't the best.  
Finding Neno is a modern classic in the vein of Taken.
I think floor puzzles are worth the investment because it's easier to keep track of the pieces and they last longer.
my son loves this series of movies he doesn't like scary he watches this and gets a kick out of it.
Lastly, this movie is for adult supervision only.  
It's almost like an animated documentary about the animals.
There have been enough movies now about self-assured exceptional oddballs in school that "Rushmore" seems a bit pale compared to some of the films it inspired.
the kid in me loved this movie and just had to own it for my collection of movies.
I received this item in the mail today.
They are very cheap plastic and tiny.
Since we have so many and we travel so much I put my movies in binders
She begged us for it and since she loves Tinkerbell, and the Wendy (I'm assuming) ballerina goes so beautifully with the theme of her room, we snatched it up.  
Bought to go with my granddaughter's Sofia Halloween Costume and it was so pretty...
The prince learned to fall in love with a beautiful girl, what a challenge.2.
This volume features Cinderella in an "interactive" storybook fantasy as well as two adventures with Ariel and Jasmine, each episode from the 1995 Little Mermaid and 1993 Aladdin TV animated series.
If you do not own Nemo and want to buy it though I would recommend buying the 3D version over the reguler version.
No one should have to  work that hard to prove they are worth something.
she loves mickey and minnie (and puzzles)
Great movie for a family movie night with an 8 year old boy and 5 year old girl!  
It's as if they said "They look pretty good...just leave them that
I always thought Belle served as a wonderful role model for kids with her love of books and learning - it somehow makes her more three-dimentional than some of the other princesses.
This series also has awesome special effects, and costume designs.
For me,the show of constant love & appreciation of my "lost" child!
This is a replacement for the VHS tape that we used to watch when my daughter (Nicole) was very young.
My 4 year old daughter recently fell in love with the movie "Return to Neverland" about Wendy's daughter Jane, so when it came time for the party, she chose a Peter Pan & Neverland theme.  
The Even Stevens Movie is a Disney Channel original movie based on the series starring Shia LaBeouf(Transformers:
She's an underdog.
Good price for the size not disappointed.
All metal except for the wheels and undercarriage but it has been dropped and tossed many times and still loves on...
That's all.  
This item was purchased for my youngest granddaughter and she loves doc mcstuffins.
Another DVD I bought for a friend.
My preferred version is the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix.
She was very much into brushing her hair and pretending she was a Princess!
What can I say?
This set is the complete prequel to Monsters University.  
I thought this was a sweet movie.
He pretends to be drunk and you wonder if his body is actually made of rubber.
we said no way - not spending that on a toydont know why i didnt look on amazon before!!!this is the disney version i think the other was mattell or somethingmy 3 yr old doesnt care what brand it is and as far as i can tell this one is just as cool for half the pricehe talks, lights up - helmet swooshes - wings open up....what more could you want from buzz!
If you can't, remember that anything to with a playing card motif, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Hearts, the stolen tarts, the Duchess, falling down the rabbit hole and the pool of tears, the White Rabbit, growing and shrinking, the Mad Hatter (and tea party), Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mock Turtle, and the Gryphon, -phew- all come from Alice in Wonderland.
During a discussion among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother fighting human hunters, making Kenai realize he killed Koda's mother.
and I think it deserved the Best Animated Feature Oscar instead of Happy Feet which may be good but not as good at this one.
I purchased this to replace a different brand that broke within 1/2 hour.
Recess: School's Out is a 2000 Disney animated feature film based on the Disney Saturday cartoon series.
Has extra features, great redone picture quality.
Pare all the fluff away and there might be a movie in there somewhere.
2 year old Grandson Matthew loves anything MickeyMade yogurt biscuits and cut 1 Mickey.
After twenty-years, this timeless Disney classic is still a beautiful film to watch and the special features on the two-disc DVD set make it even better.  
Sweet movie that is a lot of fun with many lovable characters.  
Monsters, Inc. is one of my favorite Disney movies - it is a wildly imaginative take on a classic childhood fear
This was a little irritating for me, but I understand the artistic reasoning and appreciate that Disney didn't fiddle with the original vision.
He plays with it with his other hot wheels cars.
With the easy return/refund, it may be worth trying your luck at getting the pictured one.
These items are small and if there's a drawback to this game it's that especially younger children will have troubles differentiating some of the items; this shouldn't be a problem for older kids.
I was coming to the end of an odd emotional whirlwind, and my first year of crazy, irrational high school was almost over.
For that price I say a good purchase.
And though I am hardly a critic of film editing, it jars me EVERY SINGLE TIME.
(So we get some Hollywood "miracles" to enable the outcome.)
Great toy, sturdy enough for my rough little boy.
My son likes that rug.  
This is one I know I have not seen since I was a child.
This is a movie with an absolutely stellar cast from top to bottom.
Robocat:  The Rangers discover a mechanical cat and attempt to find him a home, until Fat Cat reprograms him for his own purposes.  
His hat falls off easily
Of course I give the movie 5 stars
anyone who watched this movie growing up and wants to see it all over again i say buy it.chrisfan.
The Little Mermaid inherited those computer effects from "The Great Mouse Detective", my personal favorite classic.
The others were decent, though not terribly likeable.
There have been a series  of  bathing containers .
My daughter lit up when she saw them!
The storyline is set around the kids (and a few adults) who want to keep summer vacation.
Even though it was in the VHS format the color was clear, the sound quality was good and the price was right!!!!
If you're planning to buy other Disney items, it might be worth it to research buying directly through them when they're having a good sale.  
Another puzzle had scratches/markings on some of the pieces.
I will say again..thank you Amazon!!
We love the DVD, Stuffy, the mini Doc Doll; however, Lambie not so much.  
This movie came out in like 81.
I prefer simple and this doll was taken way overboard.  
I'm glad I own it.
I was going to purchase this, but then I realized that it was a) not in 3D, b) no unrated directors cut with 20 seconds of added gore, nudity and one extra f-bomb, c) not annimorphic wide screen, and d) not even a computer animated feature.  
I confess that I would skip the whole first scenes showing the bad fish with Nemo's mom, and you know what happens if you have watched this.  
Lots to think about, and a true heroic saga.
The story of Beauty and the Beast is one that can be likened to many personal stories in actual life.
I gave volume 2 two stars because the picture Quality is bad, but at least it has the pilot my review is for disk features & playback performance not TV show & if any information is in incorrect I will do my best to revise my reviewNow about the DVD...um well the picture quality is still low grade, the same picture quality as Volume one, DVD extra's none wish I could say there is extra's
It's among Disney's best!!!
I suggest you to buy 2 if you plan to use it for longer than 3-4 months and you can avoid the waiting time for the second tub.
Its perfect for her right now.
Well worth the money.
Peter Pan has always been a favorite of mine since I was a child.  
I am single and on a fixed income.  
A keeper for sure.
The area where you put the month says place sticker here and the shorter months don't cover all of the writing so it looks bad.  
Your best bet is get both, yes both versions for your home entertainment library, because both are just as good in their own specific way.
And of course the wise old owl, who explains that "Nearly everybody gets twitter-pated in the spring."
I will be traveling soon, and I was hoping to bring this on the plane with me, but it's a little too bulky for me to bring on the plane
Unfortunately the film is a bit long for an animated film clocking in at close to 2 hours.
Later it becomes apparent than Eloise's friend, Bill, was an old love of the aforementioned woman, named Rachel.  
But no one has seen it as clear and beautiful and "new" as when they see it on this blu-ray.
I have seen it at least 15 times.
Will buy from Amazin again.
Getting all the Disney movies on Blu Ray once the release them.  
The actress is given nothing to do but suffer interminably and, sad to say, the audience has to suffer through her.
Pixar, you've done it again.
Great movie for adults & kids.
He is going to love it!
Was not disappointed.
But this was surprisingly colorful & soft & it works just fine.  
He likes the platinum edition that adds a special touch.
If you love the movie, you will really enjoy watching the special they did on the making of the film.
He's a good size for small kids, large enough to be satisfying, small enough to carry around.  
The extras are excellent viewing as well.
It fits very loosely and falls off easily.
But with towels, you would think you could.
This is the very good movie.
this three disc set is great.  
Try a Dean Jones, Hayley Mills, Tommy Kirk, Kurt Russell, or Fred MacMurray selection instead.
Lots of modern animation doesn't grab me.
I think that the lesson above all of what Tarzan learns from the humans though is that some of them are not to be trusted.  
I did not like it much at first but as most Wes Anderson films, it grew on me.
Perfect for kids b cake but think it was really overpriced.
Careful, or someone could lose their head.
A good, loving, rounded out story with no real bad guys or anything.  
It features a wonderful, touching story about family and how they continue to survive in the wild but faces the challenge of man.  
I love Eloise at Christmastime.
Once thrown the bows really don't hit and stick to a wall, but my daughter loves being able to make them fly, which for us is really all that matters.  
But my daughter is thrilled with them, so we are keeping them.
Whether you are like me and getting reacquainted with the Muppets or being introduced to them like my daughter, this is a GREAT way to do it!  
No problems with video or service.
It is visually the most impressive and the most gorgeous animated film of all time.
Even had to get him a race car bed.  
Really love monsters, inc. and have watched it several times.  
Hulking, blue-furred behemoth James P. "Sully" Sullivan (John Goodman) and his one-eyed assistant Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) are employed by Monsters, Inc., a scream processing factory.
Surprisingly, this is one of my favorite soundtracks of all Disney movies; Phil Collins is amazing.
and you would really draw more attention and money
It's virtually guaranteed that you'll watch it several times.  
Ariel changes back into a mermaid and Ursula takes her back to sea.
This is a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone.  
Not of Disney's best but very enjoyable.
I am so excited to have it on DVD now!  
Only this thing is no balloon - it takes up so much more AIR and EFFORTS before it would inflate nicely...looking all plumped up.
Finding Nemo - A Filmmakers' Roundtable  •  Knick Knack Pixar Animation Theatrical Short.
One of my FAVORITE things about this puzzle set is that the pieces can be identified by marks on the backs.
She had a little help.  
A terrific family movie and highly recommended
Grab your copy before it goes back into the vault.
The Beast a prince deformed by a witch.
The most frightening scene for me is not the off screen disappearance of Bambi's mother, it's the pheasants hiding in the grass, trying to calm one of their own, as the hunters approach, "don't' fly!"  
The only problem I had with it is that the hair is too stiff.
Meanwhile, Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) now knows the truth of Sydney and Jack's affiliation with SD-6 and the CIA and must claim that he was the victim of a drug addiction that caused him to make up all the information about SD-6 in order to keep his life.
These are great toys for the price.
She was happy, I love my copy I have.
This was bought for a birthday present for a 6 y/o.
Love all the old Disney movies I grew up watching in the theater during the summer movie festivals.
I wanted them to have a "lovee" to get attached to.
Metamorphisis:  Geneticist Doctor Sevarius was hired by Xanatos to create replicas of the Gargoyles, but the mutations he's created are a cross between jungle cats and eels.  
Truly perfect performances throughout.
I loved the movie Tangled
Although the toy is cute it's not very functional.
This is a great classic.  
The colors are vibrant and the comforters very thick.
Mater - While I can see the hate for Mater his comparison to being Pixars Jar Jar Binks is just ludicrous!
The story was entertaining, the characters were funny, the voices were well-matched and Pixar's animation is off-the-charts amazing.
One director who never fails to make me smile is Wes Anderson.
If added anything it would have ruined the film overall.
We bring out all the figures every night when I put the DVD in.
Will be added to my grandkids collection.  
This toy is cute and a great addition to our little one's Doc McStuffins set.
Could of gotten this brand new from the Disney store for half of what I paid for it on here.  
Anderson also has a knack for picking some pretty memorable soundtracks and knows how to make a scene look better than it should, but his writing is what stands out the most.
I also purchased the Propwash junction airport playset.
Movie arrived in great condition and very nice time frame.
All-in-all and my kids  love the movie and wanted to see it again the next day.
This is really a story about intolerance and hatred that is counteracted when the protagonist walks in the other's shoes, or in this case, paws.
My daughter was so excited to have Aladdin to go with her Jasmine!  
This was the first episode I ever saw.  
Came in good time, sealed and packed safely to prevent damage.
The goal is to win plastic jewels for the plastic tiara, bracelet and ring.  
Granted, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Pinocchio" are still excellent as they go way beyond what one would expect for special features but this release is still quite solid!Overall, if this 1942 masterpiece resonates strongly with you or you are a Disney fan looking to upgrade to "Bambi" in High Definition, you won't be disappointed.  
"Finding Nemo" is no exception to any of those categories.
My granddaughter is a huge Sophia the First fan.  
He's 10 and we are on the 6th disc because he wears them out.  
Rabbit decides he isn't smart enough to find Christopher.
They sell them inside Disneyland at Enchanted Chambers and Its a Small World Toy Shop.
Some of the backdrops literally took my breath away.
Adults who take their kids to see it might be surprised to find themselves having a pretty good time, as I did when my niece and went to see at the BFI (British film institute) hasn't been a film in years, previous to this release, to use such creative energy.
I don't think there is a need to explain the plot or story line pretty much everyone knows it and is familiar with it.
One full unzip and the zipper was done.
No surprises here: this is one of Pixar's highest selling movies so you probably already know whether or not you're a fan.
When I read Douglas Adams' books there was a kind of movement and energy to them, but again a more literary type of humor that you had to translate from the author's imagination to your own.  
If you have seen Monsters Inc., the 3D Blu-ray is the natural progression to make to your collection.  
I gave it 4 Starr's instead of 5 because her bum slips when she tries sitting up.
I has to do with drugs.
nothing wrong with it love the show...my 4 yr old is very very happy so thanks again love it bye
All he ever talks about is Buzz!
I had never read the book  or seen the BBC series, but I instantly loved this film!
All of the characters are awesome and I am so happy a happy ending was given to "Disney's The Little Mermaid"(Ariel)!
I now know the meaning of life, but that's about it.  Reminds me of the sixties.
Just how screwed up is that for a cartoon aimed at the 4-10 set??On the bright side, the music is still fun, and I shocked my kids by singing along to many of the songs (equally shocking myself by remembering the lyrics at all!).
Thank you!Vt.
The dress quality is much higher, the features on the face are way cuter, and Rapunzel feels much more substantial.
I only watched the first few minutes with my son and then put it where it belonged...IN THE TRASH!
Brother Bear (2003)Disney Blu-ray & DVD (March 12, 2013)Directed by Aaron Blaise and Robert WalkerThe Voices of Joaquin Phoenix, Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, Wanda Sykes, D. B. Sweeney, Joan Copeland, Michael Clarke Duncan, Harold GouldMusic Score Phil Collins and Mark MancinaSongs by Phil CollinsSurely it was not intended to reissue Mulan and Brother Bear at the same time because they bookend the peak and the valley of Walt Disney Animation Florida.
This word count requirement sucks
The five star rating is for the dvd itself.
It provides biographical info on Frank and Ollie, their approach to animation over the years and inside info on some of the other animators they worked with during their time at Disney.  
The picture detail is great, and the perfect size for a 5 year old.
And I had to explain why no one was going to Radiator Springs - even when Sally was explaining it herself.
I remember seeing this for the first time at the theatre and was mesmerized.  
SPECIAL FEATURES:"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition" features the following special features:*
This movie has lots of small bits that are fun and it calls to the "kid" in all of us.  
All things even bugs were cars.  
Park, Canyonlands National Park, Natural Bridges National Monument, and so on, it was easy for me to become addicted to this movie.  
With the spectacular music of composer Alan Menken (who made his debut as an underscore composer with this film), the results reverberated throughout the entertainment industry.
The Jungle Book - Robby Benson7.
While the movie is a lot of fun, it lacks the heart and innocence of other early Disney classics such as Bambi or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
How this group of women set their minds to doing something worth while in memory of a friend.
Niagra Falls, New York.
I doubt if he ever will return to civilization.
When I have young ones come here I put it on for them and they sit and watch it.
IMO the first line of animator's dolls are better than the 2nd line from this year.
This is a great product for a little girl that loves Tink!
It seems as though this movie would be good for young children but has limited appeal for anyone else.
It is handy that Dumbo has several sound options-
My nephew is so into this movie ... he had me ree-du his whole room with Cars theme its been a while that Disney has made a movie that appeals to boys vs just gals..
Although this item was marked up a tiny bit (maybe $10) from the Disney Store, I decided to buy this.
I would highly recommend all these things for a little child, as my grandson absolutely loves them.
Then there's a great scene with Keith Richards, which includes him playing guitar (and, in a tense moment, breaking a string).
Everything fits great in toddler beds and cribs.
And once the aliens appear... it is a delight.
BAMBI got a beautiful, meaninful story, with soberb graphics...
I read the book once and felt literally choked up by the end--even though Bambi is alive and the new Great Prince, it felt like a tragedy!Otherwise, the only real problem that I can think of is the "mood whiplash" from Bambi's mother being killed to "Let's Sing a Gay Little Spring Song".  
And then there are the numerous Alice based endeavors, from Woody Allan's `Alice' with Mia Farrow, to Jefferson Airplane's `White Rabbit'.
Bambi (Two-Disc Diamond Edition)
I bought it for movie night.
I may need to buy another just as a back up
I purchased used copy that was in excellent shape.
I have an old VHS copy that I have enjoyed!
There is quite a difference, including the beautiful song about raccoon testicles (at 45:52 "The baby raccoon sees our balls and swings his, too).
I also think the content is a little raunchy compared to others like spirited away, howls moving castle, and nausica etc..
Barbary, Spain, France, even Russia and Arabia, but never China, and there were reasons for that as you can see in this movie as it obviously didn't work because it was yet another plot that didn't go anywhere!
I really love the option of the digital copy to take anywhere.
His performance in the film was outstanding.  
so im catching up now.  
Yes, it was a little more expensive than I wanted it to be but for such a great movie it is worth it.  
The only portion of the vehicle that's metal is the "cab."  
My husband opened up the battery contraption that houses the coil for the string and it was completely broken.
I love both the princess diaries movies.
I haven't given it to my little guy yet as this is a present from his little brother on the day he will be born, but it seems to be of high quality
This was a gift for another kiddo.
It was a no brainer for a day after work.
I don't sell the stuff I just buy it.
This is one of my absolute favorite Disney movies ever released.  
The person I would like to bring into the spotlight here is Paula Winslowe, who embodied the warmth and strength of Bambi's mother flawlessly with impeccable diction and remarkable depth in so few lines.
Belle's father, a scatterbrained inventor, gets lost in the woods and becomes the prisoner of the Beast.
Disney doing what they do best--bringing out the best in kids of all ages.
Baby laughs often during the movie and I love the music.  
My daughter just loves it!!
She gives him her word, and he lets her father go back to the village.
Certainly, this is the best pre-Pixar Disney film for animation, and although I have a soft spot in my heart for Ariel, Mulan, Aurora, et al.,
This movie is one of my favorites.  
Gepetto creates a marionette type puppet in the shape of a little boy, and wishes in his prayers the boy would come alive and become real, thus making Gepetto a father.
Totally huggable!!
but this is still a wonderful movie, full of whimsy and cuteness, albeit edged with a bit of hard/gritty reality here and there.
I've loved this movie since I was a kid and was so glad to own it on dvd.
I think it was meant to be seen, I say "I think" because I didn't see this film in 1940 (I wasn't born yet), so the best I can do is try to remember it from back in the 60's when it was in  theaters again.
I was so happy to get the author's autograph on my copy on his stop at Temple Hill in Oakland, California.
The doll is about 12 inches in height.
He doesn't complain about monsters in the dark now he has Sully with him.
His arms can be moved, and he is poseable.
One of the few shining lights in this movie is Christoper Plummer.  
However, although it had its moments, I feel that it does not live up to the quality storyline telling of the original 1961 classic.
Sturdy but soft.
3) His size is perfect relative to the talking Buzz Lightyear, Woody, and Jesse toys.  
The Prince's handsome demeanor hid a haughty selfish soul.
Bachelor monster is at the top of his game but still feels empty inside; meets little girl of another species; suddenly finds fulfillment as a parent.  
Documentary told by John Lasseter on the inspiration for Cars including a jaunt through Route 66 and seeing some race cars in action.
Still, it is a story for children, after all.
It has lots of compartments for money, coins, and fake credit cards or coupons.  
I got this for the girl I nanny for Christmas.
see the story is areal the mermaid want's to be human so bad that she has to decide to be human or mermaid if human then she can be with the man of her dreams if mermaid she lives with her mermaid family either or.  
i like it alot too.it has all the real elements of a good hearted film
I gotta admit I was tired and dosed off, a few times but that was due to an excess of  cheap wine not the film.
This is a great movie!  
The tiara is very small.
'The original Popeye, gravel-voiced William Costello, is probably heard as a statue, although IMDb assumes it's his FLEISCHER replacement, Jack Mercer.
Embittered, he retreated to Radiator Springs to brood on his disappointments.
My kids loves this movie, it's a classic for sure.  
I don't see it lasting through her toddler years.
His wings fold back and pop out when you press a button.  
The second time I watched the entire film but started to zone out because of the ridiculously complicated plot and strange treatment of the characters.
Singing and dancing.  
Just not one that held onto on first viewing.
about time this show made to DVD, watched this years ago and it is good as ever, right up there with Transformers Prime, Beast Wars and Sailor moon.
Our grandson is a fanatic for monster trucks so these were perfect for him to play with.  
This is a perfect episode to end the season on.  
3d is more depth than " pop out " 3d but still visually stunning ...
I would definitely buy these again.
OK, this was released same day as the 2 Mulan films and the 2 Hunchback of Notre Dame films to blu ray.  
Cars giving fives, messaging each other, expressing every human emotion, without humans, each one would have been funny and entertaining by itself, but the madness of mixing the action of animation and motion was overlapped by the madness of the many characters given to many car models.
Nice toys but much smaller than I expected.  
It can go in the washer with no problem, no seam problems either.
We received the one without the blue border.
I have to pick up the whole thing and carry it in my arms.
Cant wait to sit back and catch up on my childhood favorites.
If you like any of the other in this series, you will like this one.
The fact that this film made so much money from the toys is why "Cars" was the first Pixar film other than "Toy Story" to give a sequel, and guess what; " Cars 2" became Pixar's least critically successful film.
It keeps my toddler entertained!
I had prevously read the book and seen the 1981 TV series, which was superb!
Ursula wants her voice, and Ariel will have three days to make the prince fall in love with her - or else she'll return to her mermaid form and her soul will belong to the sea witch.
My son loves Hot Wheels and this is comparable if not better.  
And yet no censorship has been perpetrated and very little criticism has prevailed.
You cannot possibly expect the same voices to return as many decades has separated the two productions, so it's just plain lucky that Disney protégés embarked on taking the task to begin with, and this is far superior entertainment to most or any of today's cartoons in the first place.
She and I have red hair, so she thinks we should watch this together because Ariel looks like us.
Thus, at least in my opinion, this aspect of the film conveys another spiritualistic aspect of humanity, namely, the common tactic of scientists to "think out of the box."  (Of course, people in other professions also sometimes think out of the box.)  
She is beautiful.  
Talespin is my all time favorite cartoon show.
My daughter realized last year that she needed more prince dolls for her dances.
Overall, I'd say this nap mat is barely okay if you're looking for something comfortable for your child to nap on.
One of the best.  
Wound up getting DVD for their birthdays.
I got it for $40 on sale at the disney store and it's not worth that.
So we will wait until he can't fit in this anymore:
That's all I will say about the plot, but I will say the sound track is incredible, it's not the same thought provoking story without it.
She can't quite put it together herself yet
Tinker Bell as the vindictive, jealous female who will go as far to have Wendy killed because she doesn't like women around Peter Pan.
Thank Goodness for Amazon
Hans Conried does double duty as the villain Captain Hook and Mr. Darling, father to Wendy, Michael, and John.  
The story is a nice change for Disney, in that there is no young woman waiting for her Prince to come.
While at the same time I feel like I know nothing about the two main characters.
Not for the young.  
It makes dream references that are very accurate.  
Even with this result, it has a good story line that teaches your children the importance of nature.
My grand-children gave it a 10 out of 10 hands up, even better than the original.  
Delightful and quirky.  
Reminds me of the time I saw it as a little girl and I wanted my granddaughter to watch it as well.
So disappointing when it is a Christmas gift for you child!  
Action filled makes up for all its small comedic failures.
An excellent choice for any age.  
Smart enough for adults, but endearing for children.
great but a bit over sized car toy.
I love this movie and it brings back so many memories of my teen years.
It worked, however.  
She will have loots of fun playing with it.
First, to me the movie is too long.
The type of movie that has to be seen again and again.  
Some scenes may not be appropriate for very young children.  
So her Gramma got her all the characters & big castle for her birthday.
Home Improvement was one of those shows that I remember watching together as a family growing up.
Finding Nemo + Blu-Ray + big screen TV = awesome!!!!!This has been a family favorite since it first came out and now to have it on Blu-Ray...it is amazing.
My second complaint is the comoforter, the big tags are located at the top of it, right in the middle, so they are on my child's neck at night.
She loves carrying it around and has fun giving us all check-ups.
IMO, "The Little Mermaid" remains the best, because those working on the project could not realize beforehand what they had accomplished, and so weren't overdoing their efforts to be entertaining (coincidentally, also like "Dumbo").  
My kids all love puzzles and this one is no exception.
I wish I could have known a guy like him.
On a technical side, this movie delivers most of the Disney magic in terms of animation and scoring.
To be short, the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994's The Lion King (which does have a lot of computer work on it, but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking) and perhaps Miyazaki's 1997 Princess Mononoke (in fact, perhaps even much of the Ghibli work, almost all of which is hand-drawn with very little computer work).Some of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film, specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet.
Well, I did enjoy it, but love?
Purchased this costume (size 3T-4T) and it's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son.
I could not tell why such an empty animation game made it to the big screen.
I knew that I would have to own all 4 movies.
I was indeed pleased with this DVD.  
Otherwise it would feel like the image shrunk down to 2:33-1 with black bars on the top & bottom and this is not what the director desired.
It never gets old.
My son loves watching this movie and this is the one I remember as a kid!
Soon her ears were green, her toes, her body, her chin, under her hair..everywhere.
The "Lost In Translation" ennui has its seeds in this performance.  
"Last Trains to Cashville" has FatCat with his goons who steals a young boy's train to use it for robbing, "The case of the Cola Cult" is the best epsiode of the first season and most memorable with it's catchy tune about a group of soda worshipping mice/rats who are theives.
The characters are still the same people, with the main gang still having their tendency to get into trouble (specifically TJ), and while many of the antagonists from the show work with the other characters, they still have the same personality traits and quirks (ie: The Ashleys).My main complaint with the movie is no fault of the movie itself, but rather my own opinion.
It's cute, and big, but not very durable.
Very cute and the little hairdryer has an on and off switch and really blows the hair.  
Anything about Disney is great!
The pull string has not been an issue either.
it is MUCH smaller than I expected and the size on the box picture is NOT the size my 4 year old can pick this up after its put together and carry it around in her two hands
Now don't get me wrong it's still a great show.  
It will be fun to watch these with my grandchildren.
The fact that this isn't a musical is an added plus.  
Armstrong:  Gyro presents the McDuck household with a robot named Armstrong to do their work for them.
My daughter like it so much we decorated her room with tones of Nemo Stuff.
I thought this movie sucked and was boring!
but it is too late.
I think that's a lesson that is often missed in today's movies.
It's fast-paced to be sure, but somehow it never holds my attention.  
One of the best movies - not of it's kind, because there isn't anything I can think of quite like it.
Disney movies are awesome and I loved this one growing up and was excited to get a good deal on its release!
Figaro the cat is cute and bratty, such a delightful comic relief.
-- there is always an explanation, however bizarre, for everything that happens.
To object to killing wildlife for food (especially in areas where predators have been decimated to protect ranching), while eating pork or beef, is hypocrisy.
I just wish they hadn't made Rabbit so nasty.
It isn't something that you just loved as a kid, it's great as an adult too.
We are Disney freaks and especially love the stories of how the theme park came to be.  
I was just very disappointed and have no intention of buying any more seasons.
But when Lightning the stranger comes to town, they treat him with all the hick small town xenophobia they can muster.
I needed a few good and fun movies to show on a weekened babysitting and this was a great one.
The best season of the entire show!!Tragedy,action,love and suspense = Winning formula!
Only wish this came in 3D.  Really great Blu-ray/DVD.  
Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors and all the Pirates movies have proven to be fun, exciting and very funny.
Anytime you can find a Disney movie combo pack for your kids buy it.
I love the Mary Martin TV version - and the various stage versions too - and for some of us "I'm Flying" is the REAL Peter Pan song.
She pretends she is Merida ALL the time with it!
This arrived quickly and in perfect shape at a very good price!!I would rate this a very high 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10 stars!
We see snippets of Max indulging in each of these activities, such as beekeeping and fencing, and these snapshots give the movie a lot of charm.
It is a little small.
it has actually been YEARS since it came out.
You see a flashback of a young Muriel Finster, and the writing for the movie is pretty solid, Recess was a great TV show and this is also a great movie.
Sulley and Mike soon discover that not only aren't kids dangerous, but Sulley ends up attached with the one he ends up protecting.
I also sent a costume that is exactly the same as the doll, I thought that would be fun to have and could bring out a little girls imagination.  
Also, if you keep her hair in a big braid like in the movie, that helps to make the tangles stay away.  
Very, very funny, but at the same time very sweet.  
Great movie if you're into antonio banderas movies I like the zoro movies myself but this is a superb movie.
Also with Disney starting to make all their movies in 3D I wanted to wait but if it says going into the vault then I don't want to have to wait 10 years to buy it again let alone if they actually do come out with a 3D edition.
Second The story I have seen stories like this before but not offten and this happens to be realy good treat I love how it was written and how the story was told.
It can't be anchored correctly onto it's base fabric.  
My first complaint was that these little tiny plastic pieces at the tips of each wing kept falling off.
Meanwhile poor Mike, a member of the preparation team, handles Sulley's paperwork, arranges doors and changes his collecting cylinders.  
Our daughter enjoyed it so much when we loned it to her that she is buying it for her collection.
For me this movie was a step forward in animation as well as a great story.
The second show is the actual live broadcast of Disneyland's grand opening celebration as it happened on live television in July of 1955 featuring big stars like Art Linkletter, Ronald Reagan, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and of course Walt Disney himself declaring the grand opening on that happy day.  
This puzzle set is great.  
Snow White, Bambi, Pinocchio, and Fantasia are the greatest animated movies ever made and will never be matched.
Not all that much to say.  
My discs (the original & the replacement) BOTH won't play the Special Features.  
Aliens were more likable than the rest of the animated cast.
Disney Studios 44th full length animated feature film Brother Bear is a film that I had never seen before.
One perk about the pillow is that it is removable.
At the end of the movie (which is geared towards children may I remind you!)
Pretty impressive for the early nineties.
Completely recommended!!!
but I opened it allotted
The gems are cheesy plastic pieces that are very difficult to get into the tiaras - my husband had to put them in the tiara and even I had a very hard time getting some of them out afterwards.
I have purchased and received as gifts over the years many Disney PVC figurine sets.
Walt Disney appears throughout Disneyland After Dark announcing to home audience while conducting signing autographs to bothersome guests.
Monsters, Inc. is one of my favorite Pixar movie, although i have it all.
Unfortunately, the stakes are high as Marnie bets all her Cromwell magic that things will work out.
Won't function at all in a DVD player.  
I don't know; maybe it's a guy thing.
it's a must have
It's classic.
This series combines many things I love....exceptional writing, spine-tinging suspense, thrilling action scenes where a smart woman makes her smarts, bravery and confidence blatantly known wherever she goes....and turns it into a hard to beat, exquisitely entertaining series!  
Good for rollplaying and not difficult if she wants to take them to bed either.
Not this purchase.
I guess it helps he loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates but they are a good size to fit in his hand.
The only problem is that the movie goes real fast so you may miss some features but the good news are that you can watch this things on your own without the film (although is not quite as entertaining).
I love Madeline, I loved when I was little, and I love it now.
He is comfortable in it, loves to be in it too.  
Not a bad sequel but the kids love it.  
Some of the Big Action Sequences, the Destructive Burning Inferno aboard the Ship and the consequently Shipwrecked.
It looks like i'll be able to re plait it when it begins to looks really bad.  
Sao Feng has been holding William (Orlando Bloom) hostage for he was trying to get the maps too.
I don't think she asked for anything that wasn't included.  
Otherwise I'd search someplace else.
A never-before-seen color TV intro by Walt.
Lambie is a very important part of the Doc team, I couldn't pass this buy up!
Eeyore's outlook on life is bleak, which, to be fair, is true to his character, but the characters all end up losing faith in themselves.
It is a nice large size so it holds a lot.
I recently read some interview with Omar Sharif where he said he hated being involved with this film and basically did it for the money.
Bought this for my 2 yr old son who loves Jake and the Neverland Pirates.  
Pooh is also surprisingly inconsiderate of others in this movie; when Christopher needs to tell Pooh something important, Pooh tells him that it can wait "forever and ever".
The rest of the story comes from the book, Eaters of the Dead, which I enjoyed, and liked because of it's inclusion of the historical manuscripts information.  
The characters are very well written and grab hold of you from the get go.
She just loves it, she watches it all the time.
While I like the puzzle, it was such a disappointment for my daughter to open this on Christmas, put it together
I love mermaids.
The first DVD is the premire episode of Walt Disney's long running prime time show from 1954 where he gives viewers a preview of his proposed new theme park in Anaheim, California.  
But glad I have it for the giggle factor.
Santa brought this for our daughter and she loves it.  
Great film for kids and dog lovers alike.  
Have always been a big fan of Home Improvement.  
It also reminded me of the importance of environmental and historical protection/preservation.
From leaving the race track at night, all through the "Life is a Highway" montage, and then through the ordeal with the young punk cars, I almost can't believe what I'm looking at.  
Wan't able to find it any retail stores here in Columbus either....thanks....
Despite dating from 1944 the graphics were still beautiful and nothing looked dated in the film.
My son was very happy to get this and add another member of the radiator springs community to his set
Keep doing it...please!ONE QUIBBLE: Boo spends a considerable amount of time in the Monstropolis dimension.
They have a great time pretending to do each other's hair.
When shopping for Blu-rays, be sure to check the country code listed.
There's also a few changes made from the 2006 edition - while the colors and contrast appear to be boosted to make the image pop more, there are a few alterations in colors in some scenes, and also a few issues in the remaster, such as a random bar that appears for a split second in the climactic sea battle.
You will be surpriused with the rich color palette that the film has and the huge amount of detail of the drawings.
Childhood favourite of Madeline the book series - had to get it for my little niece to enjoy.
Puzzle is heavy pressed cardboard, much like wood, with paper film on top (which begins to peel off after several uses)*
It's just as pictured.
I thought I might, but I did not.
The only negative is the inflatable pillow.
Enjoy!3 seasons to go!
SINCE IT IS THE FIRST RELEASE OF A 3D FEATURE COMING OUT OF DISNEY'S
I watched this movie as a kid and wanted it for my kids.  
Same ones they sell at the Disney store but slightly cheaper here.
To be sure, "Monsters, Inc." is a great animation effort.  
-  I just had a baby girl and I'd love her to keep this in her running collection of movies to repeat year after year after year!
Martin Scorsese, another idol, also makes brief but scalding appearances.
Author Felix Salten was an Austrian, and his original bookBambiwas naturally set in a European forest.  
The pack of dogs was also horrific to watch as a child and still pack an emotional wallop today.  
They are very cute and send a good message about the circle of life.
She gets one everytime she uses the potty, needless to say they worked so well as an incentive I had to buy more toys and fast!!!
I remember watching it as a kid, and unlike some childhood films, it's still good.
Mickey fans will love it.
It is easily worth the $15 or so that they are asking for it.
This is when I first started respecting him as a real actor.
Plus, legendary jazz great Louis Armstrong.  
But the character development and underlying tension are the same.
Three Cheers for the little mermaid.  
I love the classics of the Disney movies.
and I was soo happy, that is untell I  looked at the finish waffle..
cute and fun movie, we had to watch it four times the first weekend.  
I have to also say that part of my accepting of this animated film is the fact that I have not read the entire Lewis Carrol stories.  
This set is so soft and warm.
It truly is one of Disney's greatest films and should be credited as such, which it frequently is.
Dick Van Dyke is one of our favorite slap stick comedy actors and this was a great film.  
Purchased this for my daughters tangled theme room.
This is wonderful when my grandchildren are here.  
Great detail and soft to cuddle with too!
Good purchase if you want it sent to your home without shopping for it.
Some aliasing appears in Sulley's fur but I think is inherent to the source and shouldn't bother you.
In the forest Bambi meets the forest animals, an owl and a rabbit with big feet.
We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old for part of his Christmas present.  
Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from?
I remember growing up watching this movie on my VHS tape on my VCR (yes, I am ashamed to admit, that is how old I am), and I still love this movie to this day.
I would recommend this toy because it is a great likeness to the character.
Me thinks they cut a lot out of the this tale.2-The "grisly" parts, literally.
Then she will need help to get it open again.
These fit my 3 year old (who wears an 11) nicely and are extremely small on my 5 year old (who wears a 13).
I can count on one hand the number of times she has played with it and we paid a lot for it.
But it is good it ties up some loose ends form the second movie.
They've also stopped giving out discs for digital copies and now we have to download the movies from iTunes.
Ironically, to my teenage daughter, who has grown up in a world in which cigarettes are not the norm in most public places and seemingly always known to be harmful, it's hard to conceive of the magnitude of Wigand's revelations, aside from the chemical additives.
More than that though, I would have loved to get into the spirit of Neverland by watching the film as we painted, but unfortunately, it was locked away in the Disney Vault.
As I said in my review of season 1:When we were kids in the 40s and 50s comics provided our escape from reality.
Ben many year since I first saw Alice and many more since I first read it.
The first film was wonderful.
Next is the same concept, but this time the screen is frozen for an amount of time due to a massive amount of cars to rummage through.
I was a kid in the early 70's so I did not get a chance to see this until I was like 12 or 13 which was too bad because by that age I was too cool to like cartoons even cartoons that were completely cool.
While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for each series on it..... ala volume two.
It has been totally and utterly destroyed in quality by the new Blu-Ray.
His role is that of a zealot, a man whose integrity of purpose can never be questioned; so when he revs up his motor and spins into overdrive one senses he is doing justice to the role.
First of all, the 3D version is kid approved.  
Comments about the 'Indian' scenes are justified...but, not to the extent that Politically Correct critics condemn.
So much negative can be said with today's journalism and in its integrity during this social media age, but to have a film in which journalism brought out a greater good in its effort to bring out the truth about Big Tobacco companies is intriguing and incredible.  
The Smothers Brothers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dudley Moore, Brooke Shields, Maryl Streep, Debbie Allen, Nathan Lane, Sammy Davis Jr., Ringo Starr, Terry Garr, and Whoopi Goldberg, just to name a few, have been involved in some sort of Alice production.
Or seeing a movie?
I liked it.
I felt bad and immediately ordered this set.
Ahmed Ibn Fahlan is drafted to join the Northmen (and they are called Northmen not Vikings) to defeat an unknown threat way up in what is probably Denmark.
How would anyone not like a cartoon feature with those voices?  
so no suprise there.
They hang easily and you can keep them and reuse them down the road.  
If the studio wants these films to sell well, they have to show a little effort!.
way!"On
The scenes and situations are so innocent, even a three year old could watch them.  
Studio Ghibli is known for producing sublime works of art that combine awesome stories with beautiful animation.
The body and dress on this Merida doll are both beautiful.  
bought this for my son.  
This movie is an old friend, and indeed I took a dozen screen shots to keep.
The guests are by far the best part of each show, even though almost all of them perform "potboilers" for which they are famous in their past careers.
They are good quality and my daughter loves them.
Besides the stars, who are all great, I'll also mention some wonderful performances by Jack Davenport returning as James Norrington and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones.
there's a charades component where a card gives a mystery princess.  
The animation is absolutely wonderful, especially so when you watch it on Blu-Ray.  
This is one of my favorite moviesPlease do pay attention to the "Red " Irish Wolfhound, his name is Connor and he's a friend of mine !
Definitely not good for young children with some gory fight scenes.
The story,the characters are perfect IMO.
My son loves the cartoon and was excited to receive this as a gift.
I chose this rating because I had expected the complete series of each.  
Less than half the amount asked here for both so basically a two for one.
Or is Disney hoping to release yet another disc in a year or two incorporating the scene into the 3D format?This is triple dipping of the worst kind.  
I have not read Crichton's novel, so I only know from what I know of history and what I saw in the film.
A little much for little kids, until they are able to handle it.  
This is certainly an excellent entry in their impressive film cannon, but still pales in comparison to their early classics.
Our daughter is 10 years old,and still wears this hat.
Simba's PrideD. 101 DalmatiansE. Peter PanF. The Jungle BookG. Lady and the TrampH. HerculesPlayVHS FEATURESPreviewsA. MulanB.
The firs one is better.  
Be prepared to commit.
DuckTales is one the best animated series ever made.
I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent.
I tried, but my measurement with the Disney animation films yardstick began with the superior Sleeping Beauty, of which this does not compare.
awesome for what it was!
Saw this many, many years ago and bought it on VHS.
They love the TV show and now they love having their own Rocket next to them and they take them to bed with them.  
For example, there are several Lego city sets that have about the same number of pieces, but are $10 to $15 less than this set.
Today the movie remains a milestone in Disney history, and is responsible for triggering a string of successes that last to this very day.
This product is total garbage.  
Original Theatrical Trailer - (2:12) The original 1942 theatrical trailer for "Bambi".
His last audible line in the film is "Good night, my little wooden goldmine."
Film purists and the not-so-easily annoyed will be more than happy to ignore this feature completely.
Was worth watching many times over.  
The humor is subtle.
Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.
You won't see that quality with this DVD.  
There were only a couple of laughs.  
I think from all the disney male characters from Disney, Tarzan is the best manly looking one.
Won't it get distracting trying to play this game when you're trying to watch the movie?
I waited so very long for this bluray and it does NOT disappoint.  
With that being said I most likely won't watch Cars 2 (Come on you read the reviews!)
For someone so determinedly middle-brow, Disney was often well-ahead of his audience.
This was an alright sequel...
He had the only heated tent on the set because the red dye removed the oil from his Wheaton coat .  
It is well made and you can't beat the price.  
The movie done great.
Luckily our Blu-ray copy has survived his rough handling.  
I did not feel much tension or urgency regarding their ultimate goal.  
It's a great family movie and extremely funny
Wayne's matter-sizer converts Diane into a 300-foot "mama grizzly" who gets Adam to sit still, and Wayne returns both to normal.  
Packaging absolutely fine and discs are perfect.
She couldn't wait for me to open it so that she could add it to her doll collection and start playing with it.  
It's a fascinating look into the process of creating a masterpiece.
This is my first time seeing it
But the story is so slow, we lost interest.  
My 3 year old is obsessed with Tangled and who could blame her?  
Should Bergman take the case to another level at the expense of HIS future?  
There are things I love about his films (The usage of colors, the odes to french new wave, and of course his brilliant music montages.)and things I outright hate (The low key sense of humor that seems to be somewhat self aware, the glaring overtones of pretensiousness).Of
Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed this one, not to mention the musical score by Randy Newman, which brings so much extra energy and life to the film.
I have literally lost count of the number of years I have waited for this to come out on Blu-ray, but suffice to say, IT'S FINALLY HERE!
The Diamond edition has the usual Disney extras.  
Let me start by saying I was more excited over this inflatable bath tub than my DD.
Fun for the family, and presents the growth of spirituality and personal development.
Voice was not far off from Tom hanks.
Most of these are from the DVD release, which I never owned, so they're new to me.
If I had to bet which one of these dolls survives toddler Thunderdome (2 dolls enter one doll leaves), I'm placing my money on the Animators Collection.
In retrospect, I wish I had just bought an actual doll instead of the plush one.
All I know is that at certain times, characters will have these halos surrounding their lines.
The quality is a lot better, I appreciate the digital copy
They are also both Mickey and Minnie fans so they were happy to get these.  
Peter Pan now available on Blu-ray for second time!
OMG this movie is hilarious the pole scene where Martin Short has to keep his head down and bangs into it while cops walking past HILARIOUS
Fun romp for kids.  
There is so much abstract song and dance in this movie at times you forget about the actual storyline.
It isn't something I would do often though.  
One more thing -- another reviewer here says this is very small, like the size of a beanie baby.
Over all i give it a 3 out of five.
But it is still strange to this day that Pinocchio, such a thing of beauty and a major step up from its predecessor, was an initial failure.
This was must see viewing!  
It has survived controversy -- Tiger Lily and the Indians are still considered racially offensive in various circles -- and weathered criticism about the liberties Uncle Walt and his screenwriters took with J.M. Barrie's 1904 play and 1911 children's novel.
Beauty and the Beast mainly tell the story of a Prince who became a hideous beast because he scorned an old peasant who becomes a beautiful enchantress.
School will be conducted by Mr. Ray (Bob Peterson), a spotted eagle stingray who will conduct Nemo and his  school mates-- including Tad a yellow longnose(Jordy Ranft), Pearl, a flapjack octopus(Erica Beck), and Sheldon, a seahorse(Erik Per Sullivan) on various adventures.
This is a cute little movie.
The end bumper part is larger than the others we have tried, which in theory should be a good thing -- except that the tube-shaped part that covers the spout is too long and loose for our spout, so the weight of the extra long end bumper part causes it to fall off.
Great, great, great
I ordered this for my granddaughter & she loves it.
This DVD had some of my childhood favorites.  
The Blu-ray looks great!
We also gave one to a friends 5 yr old daughter who immediately on unwrapping it pointed out its biggest short coming : "where's the witch?"I love that Lego has released disney princess sets in this lego scale.
We have tons of other great disney toys, not sure why this one is so poorly made.
Great for Shakespeare fans!
They have all the original dolls except Ariel as of 10/28/13 (I will also be buying Ariel.
In spite of its unnecessary additions to the plot, it captured the feeling better than anything else by a long shot.
Chip 'n Dale is funny and cute.
But that said, this 2nd set is really good.
I'll update this in the future if that turns out to be the case
nice product from disney.  
Christmas Carol (on DVD and Blu-Ray Nov. 16)Bambi: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Spring 2011)The Lion KIng: Diamond Edition (on Blu-Ray combo and DVD Fall 2011)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD Feb. 2011)Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary (on Blu-Ray and DVD 2011)
I am happy to own it in my collection. :)
We use these figures when playing the Phineas and Ferb Monopoly game.  
It is a typical plush Disney Store toy.  
When I need a laugh,  It is just a good laugh, something the British are good at.  
`You'll Be in My Heart', which is tender and sweet, sounds a tad too much like something from `Free Willy'.  
so it is not rolling around in the crib with the baby.
After a couple months of playing with it the pull string completely came out and now it is broken.
Don't regret it later!I own over 230 Blu-ray movies and watch them on my 55" 8000 series 3D LED tv.  
And there's plenty of fighting, but it is not always clear who's fighting whom -- not to the fighters, let alone to the audience.
While not exciting, this story, inspired by a true one, is touching, when it comes to answering the question, "How far would you go to help out a friend?"
the entire family was WOWed
And like most Disney movies, you of course can't help but sing along.  
I wrote drive-in.
This is a hilarious film so much fun to watch!!
I wish we owned it!
This book is absolutely gorgeous!
This movie captures the essence of the 1950's quiz show scandals, at least as far as the show "21" - there were other lesser-known fixed quiz shows and scandals of the era, but this was by far the most interesting, because of the personalities involved.
Studio Ghibli's other director (other than Hayao Miyazaki) is Isao Takahata.  
A great family movie for parents to watch with their young children.
This toy is overprice.
The doc's tool box and instruments are choking hazards for smaller children and not functional for older kids.
That sort of this captivates me and has me care.
Clumsy hands can ruin even a magnificent story but in this case Disney produced one of cinema's great masterpieces.
my wife's favorite.
I bought the 3D 5 disk version in hopes that I someday will be able to use it.  
Very stylish play shoes and well worth the lightning deal price.
It is a heartwarming film and sometimes it will make you cry, but it is well worth viewing.
My daughter is three and is just learning puzzles.  
Great fun movie drawn from actual events.  
I wouldn't any child watch until they were at least 16 years old.
An oustading restoration for an outsatnding film.
This is a great family movie to watch as well.
Found it, bought it and kids lives are complete again.
Alan Menken came onto the Disney scene with an incredible view of animated movies - why not make them as musicals?
I don't know anyone who doesn't love Peter Pan! Pirates, faries, indians, mermaids, flying children!
Marlin, consequently, goes on a quest to find his son where he meets up with Dory, a fish with short-term memory loss.  
However as this is the same toy that they sell in Disney stores for $25 I would recommend getting your Woody Figure from there if you have one close by.  
These are very poorly made.
It was not that exciting to me and I felt no tension.  
Such was the case for Herbert Stemple (John Turturro), a buck-toothed, blue-collar guy who raked in the money.  
Fess Parker and Buddy Ebsen sing (during "The Alamo" segment) on the first DVD.
After hearing that a sequel was in the works, I wasn't too enthusiastic and knew that it would be bad.
Boy saves village.
I made about 1/3 of the cake the ocean and the rest an island.
Other then that I'm happy with my purchase.
The first of the 2 episodes with Monty's parents.  
I will decide how many words if any are appropriate.
Use it all the time and get a smile every time I use it.
Needless to say, all these years later, and even 11 years after your review, I am sitting in our home stunned, moved, completely restless and completely at peace.
Bought this for my sister, I have watched it on TV the last couple of Christmas seasons, cute move.
just like the toy they sell in stores(you just cant find one in stores..)
He is the exact size I hoped he would be!
Seems to be more comfortable now. :)
It is completely impossible to follow otherwise.
We have a 50" plasma 1080, so it's distracting.  
Does not ask to see it over and over though like the Heffalump movie or the new pooh movie.
Ariel is one of my favorite princesses.
I could have purchse two sets for the price of one on Amazon.  
The characters wind their way into your heart.
It's not like this movie invented the "Mary has Three Daddies" scenario.  
But with these animated classics being released on Blu-ray, as a reviewer, as a parent, "Alice in Wonderland" has been a film that I have stayed away from until today.  
I Excellent movie 3D is outstanding!
Cute and funny.  
The Company's fleet of purpose-built warships, the Bombay Marine, consisted mostly of frigates, e.g. small cruisers with one gun deck and up to about 36 guns.
Since this was Disney's 2nd film, there was more attention to animation and the songs ("When You Wish Upon A Star," which won Best Song in 1940 and the movie also won Best Musical Score) than getting big-ticket celebrities to loan their voices.
====================================Note Disney claims they will send you an envelope for return of the discs, but I received only a return shipping label.
She will watch it over and over I am sure.
I am such a Disney fan and to get this now was great.
A must have for any Disney buff.
Effects were OK but I did not like the aesthetics...
Peter Pan, as we all wish to never grow up.  
Three brothers, Kenai (voiced by Joaquin Phoenix), Denahi (voiced by Jason Raize) and Sitka (voiced by D.B. Sweeney), return to their tribe in order for Kenai to receive his sacred totem, its meaning being what he must achieve to call himself a man.
It's not too loud so it doesn't get annoying for me like some of his other noisy toys.
This is the most exciting movie I have seen where no gun was shot, no bomb exploded and no terrorist group was terrorizing.
I enjoyed POC I....and even the overly-long scenes others didn't in POC II....but POC III....just takes the cake in extending things to the point where you become numb from watching any more.  
This set is just the right level for my 3.5 year old.
Not funny in spanish though, avoid it at all costs.
My opinion of "Beauty and the Beast" has not changed since my DVD review for the title back in 2002.  
I have the whole series
The special features includes an interactive game, a music video and a behind-the-scenes look of the film, as well as sneak peeks of other Disney classics like the re-release of Sleeping Beauty, WALL-E, and The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea.
But could there be a deeper reason?
Older kids might think its corney, but we enjoyed it for the clean cartoon humor.
I purchased this product to use on my grandchild's birthday cake.  
Soft and Beautiful Plush, looks just like Princess Sofia and is great for little girls to cuddle up to at night, she's just as soft and cuddly as a pillow without losing her form.  
Very poignant, and based on actual facts.  
A great romp through fantastic visuals and unbelievable story line that keeps moving mostly on the characters within the plot.
Can't ask for more.  
My 5 yo daughter loves princesses, and she loved the jewelry, but could care less about actually playing the game.
He's pretty rad!  
it's so short!I feel like I would profane this film if I said too much about it.  
Michael Mann's masterpiece finally on blu-ray, the cuality is amazing, but disc lacks of more extras.
Not that it isn't worth watching just to keep the continuity of the storyline.
My daughter loves Rapunzel, so naturally, she loves this.
He does not speak their language, nor know how to handle a broadsword, and their amusement at his "tiny horse" makes him something of an outcast.
Nonetheless it is a classic.
I want my nieces and nephews to have all the Disney movies and this is a great place to buy them.
Wonderful movie and excellent quality.  
Such a great movie to share with the family.  
More than anything this game is about make believe.  
The knee joint just broke, and futon inspection I noticed the there was only a this rod of plastic holding the upper and lower sections of the legs together.
I've seen the movie as a child and other times as an adult, however, the reviewer processed and shipped the DVD promptly, which isn't available at Disney any more which is why I bought it here.  
2 year old daughter loves this movie and always wants to watch it.
I was only 12 when I read it
Great addition to my Disney collection and one of my favorite Disney movies of all time.
This was a Christmas present for my children and after using it one time I realized the box was broke!
so it wasn't a complete waste of money, but it doesn't mean it was worth it.
Otherwise, look for the excellent Criterion Collection version of the film (MSRP $29 DVD $39 Blu-ray).  
CANT RATE IT.. as it has not arrived yet..
My family loves the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.
The game pieces are cheap plastic and I would have done better at the dollar store.  
It's a great series for a boy to watch in particular, because of the pratfalls and physical humor.
I love this series.  
Good time to buy while the price is down, before it goes into the vault.
Good memories are now passed on to the kids.
Pinocchio responds by waving and cheerfully yelling, `GOODBYE, STROMBOLI!!!'
They don't even get all of the humor yet
First and foremost, I must post the disclaimer that my daughter is a Doc McStuffins FANATIC!  
Bought this for my little granddaughter to watch at my house.
Living in SE KS is not very convenient.
The first time I watched this movie, on New Year's eve 1999-2000, I was flabbergasted.  
My son loves Cars and loves Mater.
My problem is with the box.
The songs in Pinocchio represent just about the strongest musical in Disney's film canon (only Mary Poppins and Beauty and the Beast have songs as good as the ones by Leigh Harline and Ned Washington).
My daughter loves watching it everyday!
I'm glad this movie was remastered , but I don't understand why there isn't a full screen option.
Not a typical Nick Nolte part, however he supportsMartin Short.
Material made to last.
I have all the Disney animated movies from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty and Alice is my favorite as an enjoyable viewing experience.
It's really cute, and is made of some type of hard plastic-type material, with a soft fluffy tail.  
Deleted Character - Harold the Merman*
The outlines of the animated characters are also sharper in this BD release than in previous issues.
I totally recommend them if you are a fan of he movie Planes like my kiddo is.
I watched this when I was young and enjoyed it.
Those of us who still pine for cel animation (or 2-D, which seems dismissive) have so much to savor in this film, in particular Glen Keane's animation of Ariel herself.
This is probably one of Antonio Banderas' best movies.  
My 4 year old is a huge Doc McStuffins fan, and loves putting these together.
He sleeps and plays  with him as well.
Let's just say that I found out "the hard way").As mentioned by another reviewer, the game is a bit too simplistic.
Well done - it's like watching it on the big screen.  
His head does not detach.  
He is fascinated by Jane and soon loves her.
We purchased this for our niece to go with the most recent book.
Snow White does bravely pull herself together and rescues herself when cast out by the Queen, but she then naively allows herself to get poisoned (and again a Prince needs to rescue her).  
The packaging was flawless, still in it's original plastic covering.
Those who liked the 'Jungle Book' movie will find several familiar characters in here, but this is a story all its own.
It's about 2 autumn leaves holding on to a branch & having a conversation about life & the unknown afterlife.
"Pinocchio" is now out on Blu-ray and it looks gorgeous.
right - far more than I was prepared to accept - but can't quite get over the hump into unbridled success.
I cannot imagine a child watching this movie and getting anything out of it.
I've certainly seen worse movies than this.  
The television quiz shows in the 1950's were at the mercy of one of their biggest sponsors, Geritol.
John Goodman is an incredible actor, and here he shines as James P. Sullivan, a monster who works in a factory that produces energy by collecting the screams of children.
They are realatively heavy.  
A decent movie about a missionary.
All of it is very cute.
What I really love about the characters is their unapologetic amorality.
Many of her outfits are cleavage-bearing, short, tight, and immodest.
I got this for my 2 1/2 year old who is OBSESSED with the Toy Story Trilogy.  
On his way home to France, the poor devil terminated what was left of his career by making the opposite mistake, and attacking a squadron of seven real Royal Navy ships of the line in the belief that it was a convoy.
Disney does princesses so well!  
She loves the Cubby plush doll.
Maybe because it's not easy finding "family" entertainment for someone in my age bracket (I'm pushing retirement here).Anyway, I'll keep on watching, and laughing, despite the stereotype.
My 23 month old granddaughter likes to play with the Lego Cinderella and Prince charming figures, so I bought her a much larger version, namely this doll and the Cinderella doll whose dress lights up and plays music.
I was so excited to get this tub.
well the product arrived on time and in good condition, however it was not quite what I remembered of Peter Pan.  
Some of Disney's best and these days generally unknown 1940s animated features follow the format laid down in FANTASIA.
This is great for all ages and even as an adult, I watch it over and over again.
I'm a first time mom and all these little things were kind of an afterthought.
EXTRAS:"Bambi: Diamond Edition" comes with a Blu-ray slipover case and a DVD fof the film.  
The reason why I am being hard on it is because I thought it was average by Pixar standards.  
I will buy from this seller soon.
This copy was so much better than the library no scratches at all!
I remember watching this when I was little and still enjoy this movie.
Every player gets crown, bracelet, and ring at the beginning and you play to win the jewels for them.
Heroines and heroes rise to the occasion.
My son is obsessed with Cars.
The blu-ray of this movie is crisp and beautiful.
No one made animated films like Disney in their heyday & this DVD is no exception.
So the adventure for Kenai begins.
I liked it, but I was not into it as much as I was "The Lion King" from 1994.
Every time I watch it I regret that it was not anamorphically processed.
It's important for people to know that prior to "Alice in Wonderland",  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II, also where the first animated film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" were a financial success, the second film "Pinocchio" was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release, wouldn't happen because of the war.  
This one was "okay".
It's fun to watch Tigger bounce and rap to, "Bounce, Bounce".
It also has glitter on the front that you can't see in picture but it doesn't wear off, its really cool.
:) disney Never fails & rarely even clunks.
For several years I still had my VHS copy from childhood, but no VCR to play it on anymore.  
Toys r us reviews are bad for the same reason.
First, the whole game is centered around the assumption that the girls playing it have watched all of these Disney movies - mine have not - bummer.
This cutter not very big but big enough for Matthew & my needs..
This is simply a great movie for anyone of any age that transcends time!
with gift set 2 cars figure.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  
Two stars because it's an awesome toy, until it breaks.
These were kind of expensive ($25) for cars that are pretty small.  
I just love watching this more.
I well remember the first time I ever saw Peter pan...too long ago to say, but yes at the Cinema.
I certainly hope that the original story is not forgotten.
That design is unbelievable.
Little clownfish Nemo is caught by a diver and taken away from his home in the Great Barrier Reef.
But let's face it, the story Disney is actually telling is a far cry from the original one written by the Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.
Maybe it was because it was in a way the preachiest of the Pixar films telling us we should slow down our busy lives and go back to simpler times.
As a plus you get Mr. Smee
There are 25 episodes on 3 discs in this set, they are all excellent.
It was, up until last year, the only animated film to receive a Best Picture Oscar nomination (`Up' finally joined the elite group, and I have a feeling `Toy Story 3' will rightfully join them this year) and it's easy to see why, for frame for frame, song for song, emotion for emotion; `Beauty and the Beast' is a notch above the rest.
Typical America business pratice today.
Tarzan decides to head back to England with Jane and Professor Porter but when he gets on the boat he finds that it was all a trick to get him to reveal where the gorillas are hiding so Clayton can capture and sell them.
Its wonderful on my new 3D tv.
Like that it has handles, I have been able to hang it on the door knob.  
I have bought all these Disney Planes characters that appear in the movie for my son.  
Only Mater, a dopey, buck-toothed and rusty tow truck befriends him, taking him tractor tipping in the night (they get chased off by Frank, an enraged combine).
Stuffy...well he is made with stronger fabric and is still talking up a storm!
This was perfect.
I especially like the scenes with Rose and Oliver.
They are the same as the Beast's, and they eventually have a triumphant wedding.
it looks phenomenal.
This was a really good pilot.  
I used to really hate this movie as a boy.  
She's now less afraid when I run the real vacuum.
While its cute, I'm just really not a fan of the microfiber feel - the sheets and pillow case have a different feel to them.
The special features includes holiday traditions reports bu Gus, Mikey, and Spinelli, as well as seak peeks at other Disney favorites like Santa who?
and if you don't have it in 3D buy it now!!!  
The picture on each film is clean and vibrant.
In terms of humor, "Nemo" has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling.  
The packaging could have been less intrusive and easier to remove.
Since it would be a catastrophe on par with a world war if he could no longer watch the movie on his portable DVD player, I am forced to replace the DVD whenever it is damaged.  
was happy with my purchase and can't wait to give it to her.
Bongo is a circus bear, a famous circus bear, that runs away from the circus because he wants freedom.
Watch any of them unedited and uninterrupted and you will be blown away.
but you really have to be right there incase he slips and goes into the water face first now.  
POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.
And I loved that I was able to squeeze in 4 hours of work.
Merit-Time Adventure:  The Nephews, Webby, and Doofus attempt to earn a Junior Woodchuck badge in sailing while a sea monster is preying on Scrooge's shipping fleet.  
Happily, this great film is now available on a glorious Blu-ray + DVD edition, and it has never looked better.
Pom Poko is about a group of Tanuki, raccoon-dogs, who live in the forests on the edges of Tokyo in the 1960s.
It is not a brand of humor that everyone picks up on.
This is my favorite movie of all time, so I've seen it a million times.
Pascal is so cute and we just love him.
Then he discovers an unexpected piece of the puzzle which verifies, once and for all, whether these shows are rigged.
You can unscrew the fire truck fromt he display and he likes to play with it.
The price I paid was great.
This is her new version of the classic track sang by Jodi Benson, but she can't really hold a candle to the original.
This is definitely one of them!
I had been waiting patiently for this to come out on DVD and it's one of my favorite Disney movies.
I'm happy with them.
This movie was around before I was born.
Life is too complicated and filled with shades of gray to be simplified at the theater, and I'm glad "The Insider" doesn't pander in that fashion.
If you grew up with this film and/or you have kids, then THIS is a great Disney film for kids and adults of ALL ages.  
Everyone should get this film as this is one of the best films ever made.
We have returned the movie to Amazon and are having it replaced.
My great niece really loved this.  
I see Ariel as a little girl who doesn't know what she wants but will do anything to get it.
And we both wait for the (possible) sequel.
We just watch the regular blu-ray and convert it to 3D which looks better than the 3D blu-ray!
There are amazingly well framed, well written and well acted scenes such as the one where Davy Jones talks with Tia Dalma in her prison cell and the scene where Elizabeth Swann finds Bootstrap Turner on The Flying Dutchman.
These planes are cheap plastic and very small.  
I purchased this, not noticing that the seller had stated "Region 2", so it would not play on my DVD player in Illinois in the USA.  
The characters are funny, flawed and relatable.
I use to love this show when i was a kid.
The Battle of the Bulge: The Rangers put Monterey on a strict diet and exercise regiment and quickly regret it while on the case of some fruit bat jewel thieves.  
My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.
and I guess it's all about the marketing
Not even the eight men of the Chicago White Sox who threw a threw a few games of the World Series in 1919 could literally pre-ordain the precise outcomes of the competitions.
I liked the story line and the acting was well done.
The package was great and it came on time.
well worth the 25 I paid, maybe 30 but not the 45 or even 55 I've seen at "toys" stores!
It was one of the better shows one could watch with their family.  
My girls loved it.  
I bought it to watch with my daughter, but I think I like it every bit as much as she does.
I'd have to turn this whole thing upside down to get the water out and frankly, it requires Herculean strength.
This was not among them.
This is one of the few Disney classics, young and old can enjoy it.
"Bambi II" just feels too stretched for what's in it, and even taking that into account
It really wow'd my 3-year old.
This is what I love about Disney, they know what their customers want and what they expect and that is simply getting quality releases each time but raising the bar higher and higher of what a release should be.  
Can't wait for our first living room slumber party.
I highly recommend it and boys will like it (perhaps begrudgingly) just as much as the little princesses in your lives.
Kit has an awesome Air Foil and loves spending time surfing the clouds.
Two disks never loaded whatever I did, and one disk loaded eventually but froze up.  
Though my least favorite of all Disney Classics, this is still worth watching and owning.
Other gems include an impromptu karaoke session to the Spice Girls' If you Wanna Be My Lover and the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive as character motivation (heck even the credit roll begins with a pretty funny rendition of Elton John's Don't go Breaking My Heart).Living legend Hans Zimmer is responsible for the film's scoring so soaring highs, creepy lows and perfectly appropriate mood settings are a given.
No greasing needed.
If you can get them at a decent price (I paid $7.99 each) go for it.
Her favorite part is that the stethoscope lights up when pushed and has multiple phrases from Doc McStuffins.
A number of established shows have done a take on the Alice story; The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, The Simpsons, Star Trek TOS, and even `Hello Kitty' took a shot at Alice.
Ill probably end up buying another one (sigh.....$27 bucks again down the drain) for one that actually works.
Ironically, they had never seen the movie and didn't understand just how cool their little "scrog pit"* is.
This movie opened the door for my children and their friends and myself to talk about the Alamo and the role of Davy Crockett.  
I only gave it 3 stars because of course he loves them.
so the fun she has is worth the price but be aware it is NOT that big!
This movie is not only historic but funny at times, sad and will create just about every emotion including suspense.
So, I thought I buy this as well as The Lion King 3D.
It would be really embarrassing to walk into a room where your five year olds are discussing the ramifications on world peace, stability, and the food supply, from a marriage between a land based Kingdom and a Sea-God dynasty, if all  you can say is "Now children, it's only a movie!".
Good story and if you like watching Good Looking men play the hero's, you won't be disappointed.
Clean, good humor, silly, what can I say.
Full Frame movie* Aquarium*
FAST SHIPPING GREAT PRICE
When we ordered this we paid $30+ on amazon, I didn't discover the pricing difference until after I had already placed my order.  
I had no experience with Douglas Adams' fiction when I saw Hitchhiker 's. It took me a few years to even watch the movie because the previews just never struck me as particularly interesting.
The first thing that you will encounter in the bonus features department is the new "Disney Second Screen".
This was a gift for my Grandaughter, the only thing I didn't like was her hair kept falling out and was a mess I had to tie it back, should of came with something to tie her hair back.
so I know the music and it alone is worth paying for,  Not much to say beyond that as you'd have to be a visitor from another planet to not be familiar with Tarzan or his story.  
my granddaughter just loves this movie., grandpop even calls her Winnie pooh so she watches it all the time.  
He escapes and meets a girl bear who slaps him.
The Last Leprechaun: The Rangers go to Ireland where they meet the last leprechaun who is being hunted by a Banshee who wants his magical pot of gold.  
See the wolves in the other light.
a film that made me appreciate Walts world when i first saw the picture back 1953.i always under the impression The Robe was first in wide screen?
Its a good size and came in two days with amazon prime!
Other live people cannot do so, so they think that he's nuts.
But Disney eventually would issue a re-release of the film in 1974.But for today's current generation who have watched only the live action film of "Alice in Wonderland", now is the time to watch "Alice in Wonderland" as the film is receiving its 60th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray and DVD.But before watching this film, for those only familiar with the live action film, think about "Alice in Wonderland" (live action) as a sequel to this animated film.  
My son is a huge Toy Story fan and has been asking for a Zurg for quite some time.  
It also has 2 princess buttons that you push and they play songs.  
Excellent DVD ww2 movie a powerful movie of saving Jews and helping people who needed help to survive the horror of hitler monster it's a good movie so go buy it
She went through a Tarzan phase where she wanted to watch this video again and again.
As new and exciting an idea as what The Lion King was when it was released.
Only problem is, "Marty" is one of Stempel's favorite movies, and he knows very well it won Best Picture.
A great release from Disney.
Another reviewer complained it was degrading to women....
Howard's Lecture* Crab-E-Oke Sing Along*
The first season of Alias proved an emotional roller coaster of excitement, never breaking its momentum even at the heart-stopping finale.
So, bearing that in mind, it is best as a remembrance of seeing the film as a child.  
Walt Disney was a life-long animal lover, and "Bambi" presents a view of "Nature" and Man's relationship to it that is too-often naive and sentimental.
Be ware of return policy...lack of exchange policy!
In fact, in a way, all of this is reminiscent of our own desired destiny; a journey onwards into a world of great wonders and fewer limits in terms of what is and isn't possible.
Beauty and the Beast Music Video: Performed by Celine Dion & Peabo BrysonThe Broadway Musical1.
Since I never, ever leave him alone, he's not in any danger and I pull him up immediately.
I'd definitely consider getting her others in this line.
He gets scared when the large combine tractor (the one that makes the bull noise) comes on.
To witness all 7 of my grandkids spellbound by this incredible piece of art is a dream fulfilled!!
The story has a moral that all kids should pay attention to and cars is a must see for elders too.
I don't know what Omar Sharif is so embarrassed about.  
She uses a little bag to carry al her dancing stuff, then i came across this bag.
I also am very interested in animals as they share thiss planet with us and besides I love them I espically like wolves.
If you don't own any edition, then the Blu Ray is by far the best choice.
What can I say except I love Beauty and the Beast and it'll forever be a movie that I'll cherish and treasure years to come.
My 5 year old daughter loves them and I tend to get more excited to watch them then she does lol.
You will hear something from your rears, but it won't match more recent releases.
The amount of glitter on Jasmine's pants was insane!  
When asked who her favorite characters were, well of course Lightning McQueen and Mater.
I asked for it for Christmas.
This is a classic children's film and makes for magical viewing for both kids and adults alike and is well worth watching.
It's by far the best looking Lambie doll I saw and has held up well with a 3 year old.
The transcendent crime, of course, is the inferior transfer we have to live with.
Only a tiny number of characters made after their time (or even after this film) have come anywhere close to equaling the marvelous achievements of the cast of characters, animated and ACTED (which is what character animation is, essentially) with such fussy detail.
BullsEye know gets to watch Toy Story with the others atleast once a day!
Now like most kids I have met that watch this show my little one has every character memorized and is a HUGE fan of the show.
If you're looking for crisp traditional waffles this is not the iron for you, but if you just want something quick, easy and cute or want super fancy pancakes this is a great choice.
He is taken away to Sidney, where they find a new "home" at a fish tank in a dentist's office.
I have not yet washed it, but it seems to be some great material!
This is one of those Disney classics that I think all kids will enjoy.  
It's well made, durable and the boy is all about taking him everywhere he goes now.
I hope to pass these movies on to him for his family and children when he have one.
Why in the world is this particular movie NOT available for digital "purchase"?
as long as my kid loves it.
I bought these for my two year old son who loves all things Cars and Mater.
Thank you  Rose and Jenn
I got the cheapest one I could find from an outside seller on Amazon and it was well over double what it sold for via Disney.
black is black.
One of my most favorite Disney movies.  
This is a new classic, i have seen this movie at least twenty time & i love it every time.
A must see.  
absolutely gorgeous cinematography....
Rob Morrow was good in his roll, he can't really be a lead actor, but he shines always in supporting rolls--just my opinion.
We watched it EVERY day while both parents were working.  
It's not something cheap.
It was almost $30 for that set.
I really dont know what else to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.
I picked up a couple and she loved them.
According to my friends at Disney this Blu-ray edition will be be released on 10/1/13.
The commentary was very informative and I liked the special featuring Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio (all grown up now, of course, but still has a boyish face despite the thinning hair) and Real Life Geppettos.
The tail is very fluffy and fun to brush.
We also purchased the Elsa who is also gorgeous so my two little girls can play together, they love them!
No parts are moveable so it is basically just a little cheap plastic statue.
I am sure we are not the only family that loves this movie together as a family.
Such a great sitcom.
I would definitely recommend this film to a friend, and I am recommending this movie to you right now.
She is not made with strong fabric and tore at the neck seam on the first day...then the voice box stopped working.  
My son can carry several around at a time or put them in the back of his Mickey Mouse Clubhouse tractor.
So far it has held up to some pretty aggressive play.  
Next time you're agonizing over what to get from Netflix, etc. ponder no more.
This is a great movie.
Classic movie with timeless characters.
I could watch this movie twice a month and never get tired of it.
LOVE LOVE LOVE the quality of this Disney Doll!
Worth watching more than once, makes you go awww!
This was my favorite movie as a child and I wasn't having any luck finding it in stores, but luckily found it here. :)
Presented in standard definition and was included in the original 2002 DVD.
I have yet to speak of the everlasting quality of the story: the durability of the tale of a little puppet's ambition to become a real boy is perhaps the key to everything that makes the film work.
Received right away!  
I give the movie and the picture and sound 5 starsHowever in an age where we have bluray which can hold the info of 10 dvds it is sad to say that Disney did not utilize this to add on any bonus features other than a deleted alternate opening which can be found on the Ultimate Collectors Edition DVD which was released in 2000.  
Just hoping to spare other shoppers.
With all due respect to the people who prefer the original, I hated it.  
The last act of Monsters University I thought was done much better.  
Would purchase again!
Thye film is effective enough without our having to be hammered into submission by an overpowering score.
Learning to live in balance with our surroundings is something all modern societies struggle with.
think of it as a snapshot of the ideals and attitudes of the time and place from whence it sprang (as indeed is every film, really).
The transfer is awesome.
But they were hunting easy money.
For the price, though, it is pretty soft and seems to be well made.  
maybe 13 or 14, and i gotta say thAT IT IS ONE OF THE COOLEST ANIMATIONS I EVER SEEM...
What I wish to concentrate upon is certainly not new either, but I believe is the central theme of B&B; - true happiness and love can only come from overcoming selfishness and thinking of others.
Marlin, of course, wants his son back and, for his luck, is able to find a clue about Nemo's whereabouts.
"Turning Point"Partners In Danger Chapter I
I thought I saw this movie as a little boy, but after viewing it, I realize I must have only seen excerpts from the old Wonderful World of Disney.
After a couple weeks now, the only thing that has failed on the toy is his right hand came off.  
Read a whole lot of reviews and no one mentions the 3d.
Kenai meets an assortment of interesting creatures in his adventures through the forest, including bear cub Koda, two moose named Rutt and Tuke, woolly mammoths, raucous rams, and others.
"Princess 2" is a genuine, refreshing challenge to make a difference in our own "worlds"--now!
Then she put something or a cookie in her mouth and ate it to become large again.  
My daughter loves it.
Adult and baby entertainment!
Not to mention that her grandmother was running the show since her husband died in the movie and things weren't falling to ruin.
THANK YOU for making my granddaughter's(2 1/2 yrs of age)
It wouldn't have fit in & probably would have slowed the film down.
My daughter loved them!!
Its a shame that you can't get goof trop in the same format.
I'm very happy to have this gem in my collection - thanks for the fish!
Probably my favorite movie when I was a child so adore it still today.  
They are funny and reminds me of my family sometimes!
Working out just fine.
Now as far as which is better the old Winnie the Pooh or the new I say to each his own.
One of my favourite Cartoons and I love it so much
Enjoyable lil film that I need to rewind & watch again!
But even that I told myself it was just a movie so don't take it so close, I still felt empty.
Wendy is like Betty, Tinker Bell is more like Veronica.
She loves her Tangled bedroom theme and this was the perfect accent.  
An awesome documentary and addition to "Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition".*
We have been having problems with Amazon streaming though.
I am not sure it is featured on the DVD of this release, but I hope it is added to ALL future Disney blue-ray discs releases of the classics, it is * Inside Walt's Story Meetings - Enhanced interactive edition".
And her fiance also has a secret share.
and yes it was worth it and the show is still just as good as it always has been
Launchpad's Civil War:  When going to Virginia for an American Civil War reenactment, Launchpad encounters aged Union veterans who once served under his ancestor, who had lost a battle.  
The multiple outfits were fun (especially for sisters and playdates!), and I really did appreciate that the outfits came in a reusable trunk/box.
She loves it, and I love watching it with her.  
This movie is my 4 year old son's all time favorite movie--Cars 2 is a close runner up.  
Sure, he is listed as Executive Producer, but that could mean anything.  
I DO relate to this movie quite well.  
I usually love Disney live-action pre-dating the late-90's.
He's a big boy with his own wallet.
It was at first a tough to figure out as they all look kind of cute in pictures.
they go through the washer just fine and come out nice and soft still.
A real classic of the Winnie Pooh series nice way to start movie night together.
I came across this movie by accident.
the front toy/shampoo holder is great because I can rest the baby shampoo bottle and water cup in there as well and he likes to put his toys in there and then grab them out.
THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT GIVE IT 5 STARS IS DUE TO HER HEAD HAVING NOT AS MUCH MOBILITY AS THE 4INCH DOLL WHICH I GOT DISCOUNTED AT THE DISNEY STORE FOR $7.
This was a good movie to watch for dachshund and dog lovers.  
I watched Kim possible years ago and was excited to find it on DVD, so I ad to get it.  
It is cute and exactly as pictured.  
I watched this with my grand kids and we all enjoyed it.  
To The Rescue: The origin story for the Rescue Rangers.  
It was easy to get caught up in the storyline.  
This sheriff die cast was a great deal considering that it is larger than regular die cast car and is of display quality.  
One reviewer said the characters were not developed (????).  
No papers are mentioned.
Very interesting story focusing a Wolf's adventure inside Their own habitat ...
Another version of the story I had never seen before and I enjoyed it alot.
We LOVE this movie but unfortunately the center plastic that holds the disc was broken so the disc was sliding around in the case.  
The audio is equally as good as the video which is really saying a lot.
The toy looks fun
This new release of Peter Pan is a must have in your Disney collection.
We don't have to grow up and "give up" our dreams.
It was very good and had some sad moments in it also, My son liked it too,and we would recommend it.
Our son loves him too!!
The animation is what is expected of Disney.  
I would recommend.
Another new extra is Carly Rae Jepson's music video and rendition of "Part of Your World".  
"Alice in Wonderland" has zany backgrounds and wonderful voices provided by many great radio performers of the time:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Bill Thompson, Sterling Holloway and the like.  
The Blu-Ray edition does not duplicate that experience.  
for our boy.
Cars are getting into crazy situations that are in their own way a slight play on human issues.
Gave to a friend who wants to be an inner city school teacher and make a difference.
Sparky is a great character.  
It was reasonably priced, so it was the best of both worlds.  
So glad that it we re-released.
The two are hunted by Denahi who fails multiple times to kill Kenai, still unaware that he is his brother.
I don't plan on letting my boys watch this one again.
Max is struggling at school and is informed that he'll be expelled if he flunks another class.
is give a son made of wood brought to life  by a blue fairy.
Yours truly, Peter SmithUpdate for 6/18/2014 I also purchased a copy of this DVD as a gift for my mom's best friend to watch with her kiddos and I know that they will really enjoy it as much as I did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The story of a baby deer's first contact with the outside world and all the trials and tribulations that follow.
my kid loves this toy mickey mickey mickey thats all i hear so this was the perfect gift for the occasion
I found the originals on Amazon and Ebay, but they were just so expensive.
I emailed Amazon about it.
It will be a modern classic... just buy!
I purchased Flynn Rider with all the movie characters and the castle last year.
No wonder blu ray is struggling in the market place.
Duckworth’s Revolt:  After being fired by Scrooge, Duckworth and the boys are abducted by plant aliens and enslaved aboard their ship along with dozens of other kidnapped aliens.  
Meanwhile, vying for place as second in command, Brooklyn, Lex and Broadway must come up with a plan to free their friends and defeat the Pack.  A+31.  
Eastwood and Affleck have churned out some great movies taking on the triple role such as Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, Blood Work, Gran Torino, and The Town.
If a revamping of the series were to be done, or rather a fresh take on the original material, I think a TV series dealing with installments would be more appropriate than trying to cram all of the books into one huge two-hour plus long feature film.
and they love dress up.  
Great movie to enjoy with adults and children
My son really enjoys watching it as well.
This review is on its somewhat mediocre "70th Anniversary Platinum Edition."I must admit, the picture and restoration look a little bright, but it looks the same when the movie was released to VHS in the '90's.
Magic HappensBonus FeaturesI.
I gave it a 5 star rating.
Much of the painting is sloppy and uneven and Minnie's face is melting into her shoulder.
The Queen of Hearts also scared me as a child and I believe that a small child could definitely still be afraid of both the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter.  
This video is a very important part of my little one's day!
I love that I can pour in the batter, close the lid, set the timer for 3 minutes and walk away.
These are meant for kids after all, so even if there's recycled footage on here, kids wouldn't care.
While this feature appeared in the Platinum DVD, this Enhanced mode is way better.
George of the Jungle 2 is one of the funniest and one of the best Disney live-action DVD's yet.
I don't think we could be more happier, I have since washed this product many times, and it has held up well.
In an animated setting, it is impossible to imagine anyone else in these roles.  
The birth of television addiction and everyman's 15 minutes of fame.
Irina Derevko has turned herself in to the government, offering to share information in return for a lighter sentence.
This is very cute.
Actually, I can think of a handful of moments that wouldn't shame a horror film: the coachman bribing Honest John to draw little boys to Pleasure Island; the little boys turning into donkeys; Pinocchio locked in a birdcage, etc.Music - "When You Wish Upon A Star" is the obvious standout here.
I am sure this one will be a hit as well if I can ever find one at a reasonable price.
I gave them to him for Christmas.
I review a film for what it is supposed to be in my opinion and for this film it is light hearted, suspend disbelief and go with the flow fare.  
Maybe because I watched this so late after its release but I found it
but i just realize that i needed to tell you how wonderful this movie is i have no scratches or mailing damageThank you and hope we do business again, Nancy Pistorio
It is a good family movie, and I recommend it to anyone and all ages.
If those don't blow your mind, then I guess you can skip it (though it might be time for eye glasses...)
We had just watched "Happy People: A Year in the Taiga" and it brought me looking for this film, for reasons I suppose I understand now.
We get it, Elizabeth and Jack have a little sexual tension.
I would love to see this film in HD.
Peter Pan tells the story of a young boy who refuses to grow up, but at times act likes an adult.
You won't be disappointed.
The Blu-Ray:This is an EXTREMELY impressive transfer.
This one was a perfect replacement since it was the 2 disc edition
This is a good little adventure.  
(Who would ever think you could use darkness and Disney in the same anything.)Disney has so far done an outstanding job releasing its back catalog into Blu-Ray.
It was in great condition and came quickly.
I bought it because she is into the Disney princess them and it was an extra gift to add to her collection.
There is a fair chance you will be in the group that loves this film.
The price was excellent too, this item is a true collector's gem that is a must have!!!!!!
DVD is part of the 4 movies int he Pirates of the Caribbean Series...fans should get them all...
Our grandchildren love it as much as we do and after the VHS tape was worn out, we got the DVD version and it is always a most popular request in our home.  
From all the classics from DISNEY, THE LITTLE MERMAID is one of the best!
but girls (Tinkerbell, Mermaids, and Tiger Lily included) have crushes and are MEAN to other girls that have their eyes set on the same boy.  
The theme of the movie is the search for the meaning of life.
but now it's my 10 year old son's Dvd.
Well, to be honest, I really don't like this film that much, if any at all.
Little did the public know that the show was entirely scripted and that Herb was told the answers in advance.  
Unfortunately my two year old bends the rubber tips(feathers) and broke them.
She loved the Toy Story and made me buy all three of them.
This is the greatest Disney Film ever made, filled with laughs, tears and frights, Disney outdid themselves with this film.
Extremely well thought out!  
Fess Parker does such a great job in these movies, I love them expecialy the river pirates one, they are such heart warming films, I definantly recomend them.
I sent Mickey, to my 2 year old grandson for Christmas.
We can't wait for Finding Nemo Part 2!
How this is resolved is in the film, a wonderful romp that does have a point for it.
This is truly a princess movie!
In this film, as in most, he was perfect!!!!
I WANTED THIS ONE BECAUSE SHE APPEARED SMALLER WITH A DIFFERENT FACIAL EXPRESSION.THE CHINA DOLL WAS MISREPRESENTED!
I would've thought it would've made a big difference moving to blu-ray, but I can't see the difference with this animated film.
The idea is great based on the same transformation in the tv show but is challenging to execute.
In Alice in Wonderland, all of the animals talk.
The action is wonderful, the songs are original and catchy, and the kids will love it.
All her joints move very easily for little hands.  
It would not have held up.  
Sofia is so cute and a good child actress.
I have read that some people do not like the stories but when I was a child I knew I couldn't do the things she did - although I had carte blanche for room service whenever we stayed at a hotel...
Actress Jodi Benson, who played Ariel, taks a trip with her children to the Magic Kingdom in Walt Disney World to check out New Fantasyland.
This is a really fun and entertaining movie.
I can't say it any better than the other reviewers here already have.
It's a great value with great additions for a great movie!
We love watching our gandsons pretending to be Peter and fighting Hook.
My kids also love watching this movie as well.
The village becomes famous.
My daughter is fairly gentle, so we haven't been abusing this by any means.
I purchased the item so be happy with that.
Dopey plot aside, the best moments involve Nanny (Emmy nominated Julie Andrews) and the incorrigible Eloise (Sofia Vassilieva).  
It is an excellent movie!  
We already owned the Cars movie on DVD, but I decided to plunge for the blu-ray version in hope of 1080p Full HD quality.
a great family movie.
Thus, on the surface, this is a standard Disney adventure, good vs. evil, seen in everything before it from Snow White to The Little Mermaid.  
Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House3.
There is no compression artifacts, no banding, no scratches or dust, it looks perfect!If you love this film, you definitely need to upgrade to Blu-ray because "Peter Pan" looks fantastic in HD!Because the film is presented in 1:33:1, once again, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings back the "DisneyView" featuring the art of Cristy Maltese, so instead of the black bars on the side, you can opt for colorful artwork that matches the scenes of the film.
You use your DVD remote to click on various tools, and clips pop up for a few seconds; not really worth the time.
QUOTING FROM THE MOVIE --IF THAT'S OKAY?BBBBBI bought it for the song:" Where Ever You Are"Pooh Bear, missing his friend,Christopher Robin, sings : "Come out moon Come out wishing star Come out Come out
My granddaughter was pretty sick when this board game arrived and she really wasn't patient enough to try to "win" the charms for her crown.
This is especially evident in scenes painted with color, like the driving range sequence in which Crowe is drenched in a green tint that rivals Margaret Hamilton.
Then there was many plots that needed to be followed in order to live the intense 90 minutes of the maddening animation.
Anyone who catches you holding him can't help but smile and comment.
The unexpectedly large uproar, their husbands' varying reactions and the effect on the women themselves is funny, touching and enlightening.
I loved it.  
Great movie, Funny, Stupid, Crazy, Worth it .
With our Amazon Prime shipping, it almost beat us home!
Bought this doll at the Disney Store for my 2 year old's Easter basket and she loved it!
My granddaughter now actually picks up her dolls and puts them in the hamper at the end of the day!
When you watch all the episodes, one after another, the repeated opening routine becomes very boring.
He plays pool, smokes cigars, and drinks beer (for those parents who are sensitive about that stuff, you might want to watch this part with your kids so you can discuss the good vs. evil).Most of the animals in this movie have personalities.  
I purchased this video for my grandchildren who had the first volume.
In fact I thought Monsters University as a whole was better than this film despite that film being quite cliché as well.  
There are plenty of entertaining scenes.
It is easy for her to understand and and grasp the concept.
i never really liked this movie that much but watching it in blue ray its more clearer and the sound quality is amazing i now love the movie its fantastic
Watching Belle singing on the hillside at sunset gave me goosebumps it was so awe inspiring.  
I have also given it as gifts to friends with kids.
A young Keri Russell plays Mandy, the cute, nubile babysitter that Nick has a crush on.
It is one of her favorite toys since she got it, and she loves changing it from Perry to Agent P.
On time and will keep buying from U guys, no damage on the movie or the case keep up the good work
Very funny movie about a true event and an important subject  (actually several subjects - remembering a loved one you've lost; and the beauty of aging people).
I bought this to replace the VHS I own.  
Its obvious this franchise is in it for the bucks, as the lemmings will salivate to the theater to see films like this, but we all know they are marketed for the very lowest common denominator of film goer.
I had trouble watching this thing to the end.  
She picked the seat up at the local Babies R Us store.
INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER FOR A MOVIE CHICK FLICK.
But I am going to buy her at the Disney Store because she is slightly cheaper there.)
I have helped my 3 year old do this puzzle 4 yimes already and we have only had it for 3 days!  
We all loved the first one, but hoped at least my children would enjoy this second one, and it was so pathetic, my little boy turned it off, and asked if he could put it in the trash!
Great for any fan of Jake and the Pirates!
It had everything she wanted.
The clash I've wanted to see since the Green Goblin's introduction.  A+41.  
I always enjoy Kirk's dramatic roles better than the goofy comedies.  
Hotel Strangeduck:  Scrooge turns a castle once owned by mad scientist into a hotel, but he doesn't believe that the place is haunted.  A+9.  
3 1/2 Stars.
So far, we are very satisfied with this item!
Once again we watched cars with the grand kids, love the movie, the moral content is top notch
bought this for my 3 year old.
When this first came out I almost puked that Antonio Banderos was in it as I thought it was just going to be an action vehicle for him.
In watching the Blu-ray, the wizards at Disney have done an amazing job at capturing the magic of this film is vivid detail.
It was fun to "remember" the story of Alice again, but also, it left me with a desire to see how else the Alice story has been rendered.
It gives a rather hectic film a moment's pause, and it's consistent with Carroll's description of Alice as someone who boxed herself on her own ears in annoyance at her own behavior.)
It is extremely soft and has no small parts.
The blanket is a little on the thin and light side, but right now it's warm so I approve.
I don't know what it is about this movie, but whenever I've had a bad day or feel upset, I pop this in and it just makes me feel so much better.
It seems a messenger has arrived asking for helpto rid their village of an unknown menace.
Just give me plain old silly and wholesome and I'm good.  
He also refuted the idea that he was a game show fanatic who asked to appear on Tic-Tac-Dough.
Great characters, animation and a sweet story line.
I have watched this one twice and even loaned it a family member to enjoy.
Love it more each time I watch it!
The animation is beautiful, dark, and scary.
Doesn't matter to my 3 year old daughter, so that's fine.
The molds add a fun element to breakfast.

That kind of sucks considering that I'm planning on buying a 3D tv in about a month.  
They even prefer a Sesame Street puzzle to this and they don't like Sesame Street.  
What isn't to like with this cast.  
Such quality at such a low price.
I ordered this movie for someone else and they liked it also very much and will order more of the same
One day he meets a bear and a struggle breaks out.
And the movie has FANTASTIC reviews.  
My kids chose and watched this one.  
All of the actors fit perfectly for these roles, It was so great to see a great animation of these funny actors
I've attempted it twice now, and I just think this movie is a little to weird for me.  
The cast of the movie is great--Ralph Fiennes (Charles van Doren) is perfect; Rob Morrow (Dick Goodwin, who investigates the wrongdoing) plays off him ideally, and the versatile John Turturro is terrific as the unlikeable but sympathetic Herb Stempel.  
For people that were not familiar with the classic JM Barrie novel, which is probably very few children at the time, this movie embodied the story of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys for everyone, for all time.
I only remember this film in young feelings.
I wanted a spinning ballerina/tinkerbell.
It's a Classic movie and a great one for kids.  
James Sullivan (voice by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) make a great team...a great monster team that is.
My 6yr old now loves it too and puts it in the dvd player to watch multiple times throughout the week.
Took a pocket knife to get most out.
I never saw the large Sven at the disney store so I can't compare the quality but I love this Sven.
The film was in development for over two decades and the overall look of the film is even more impressive on Blu-ray.
Well like I said when I first saw it I got what they were saying, but wasn't impressed.
Children and adults of all ages will enjoy this movie as it has become a modern day classic.
A great little series and something new for the kiddos to watch...
Expensive purchase but overall its Ok and my daughter does love her Doc.
It was worth the money.
I prefer the curvy Disney fairies to the skinny Disney princesses ;)
This is WONDERFUL!!  
Good quality, shipped fast.
She fits inside the bear perfectly.
There are a few things missing from the DVD to the Bluray and Bluray to DVD so if you want all the bonus feaures you have to watch both discs.
Songs include "Part of Your World", "Under the Sea", "Poor Unfortunate Souls", "Les Poissons", and "Kiss the Girl".
It never gets old.
So I just bought another.
This is old school Disney.  
Original good plot, Amazing 3D picture and colors, bright clear picture, lots of fun, good for all the family any time.
I would show this to any young daughter or granddaughter out there in a heartbeat.
The music was crisp and the picture was clearer than I remember it.
Like many of Disney's old classics, it's not at all about cutesy animals.
Johnny Depp fans will love all four movies
This movie arrived in perfect condition and faster than promised.
It's full of action, suspense and romance and it's funny.
I bought this for my son to go with his Buzz Lightyear.
If you don't know the movie Bambi, you need to watch it immediately.  
It doesn't work half the time and I am to lazy to try and return it.
This is a great movie for kids and grown ups.
Duck Tales is a great series for both children and those of us who are kids at heart.  
It is action packed and so much happens in this season.  
It ripped the first day.
The scenes where the guys drink the strength medicine are hilarious - steam comes out of their noses!  
This by far one of Disney's best films!
You can't beat this one.
We were relocating and needed a place where my daughter could keep her toys nice and tidy in the hotel.  
and yes I would watch it again
The Dazzling Princess Board Game is really more of a card and role-playing game for two to four young ladies who enjoy playing princess.
We should be really scared.
Let's face it, when we're buying any kind of video product, the picture is the most important thing.
Those movies are smart, character driven stories.
This was our first pick...he really loved it at first and it has some catchy phrases, but the blaster doesn't actually blast anything.  
i love the booties much more than the hat.
Very cute, and we loved the softness of this product.
Her head broke off inside her body and fell out/off.
I had to tape the package back together
There was a story that was a little dark and the children who were watching did not like and neither did I.
If your child (both my son and daughter LOVE these) is a fan of the Disney fairies, this a perfect gift.
The constant movement and bright colors attracts younger kids.
it wasn't a waffle..
It does however get more attention and use than many of the other "old" toys from time to time.
They would be good for a cake topper or decoration, but not for play and certainly not worth 25$.  My 3 year old son has already broken several of the propellers off and has barely had any interest in them.
and it stuck with the story line.  
Katherine Beaumont ('Alice In Wonderland') is beguiling as teenage Wendy Darling; whose childhood infatuation with tales of Peter Pan develop into a relatable (if very 1950's) teen crush.
I'm a big fan of Disney movies and was surprised to find and original Bambi in the eggshell case.
We start off with our first episode known as "Catteries Not Included" where some of the city's cats are being kidnapped especially a cute kitten by a robotic dog made by an evil Professor Nimul as the team must save them before he does something fiendish, then we get " Three Men and a Booby" where a weeping mother Booby bird consults the rangers to find the fiend who has stolen her egg.
Based on Lewis Carroll's novel and an inspiration for the 2010 Tim Burton-directed updated, live-action version, this film tells a unique and colourful tale of Alice(who
What is up with this?I bought these because my 3 year old loves airplanes and I truth Disney.  
The helmet has issues with popping up and down, which happened pretty much right off.
I was impressed with the detail visible in the animations, it was like seeing the movie in the theatre.
It also captures very well the gritty, difficult circumstances of that era.
Pros: Great Direction and cinematography, Musical Montages galore, One of the truly great Soundtracks, Great Performances, FunnyCons:
The writers still have some twists and turns to keep everyone interested.  
he sits well in it.
However, the cushions on the underneath (wish they would show you that on the product images) are just that, a cushion.
This chillie looks just like the one my daughter watches on the television.  
Our whole family loves this movie and even though we gave it to only one of our children  we all sit around and watch it.  
There is a skull, an anchor, feathers, and I believe a sword.
Even though I purchased the movie for my granddaughter, I enjoyed the movie myself.  
It has held up wonderfully.  
Using a closet door portal system, monsters are able to access the bedrooms of children to sneak in scare the ba-jesus out of them for "scare power".
I like the live-action version with Johnny Depp better because Wonderland is more than a dream in it.
It's a weird review, okay--I freely admit that, but this really must be addressed, so--what can I do?  
Disney's recent release of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST on BD looks so good that it has the appearance of 3D. As I watched this blu-ray, the colors seemed to jump out and have a three dimensional space.
They have not watched the film all the way through but I have and thought the sequences with the voodoo mermaid leading to the end very prolonged and violent for their age.
Now I know I sound all preachy with my review
A very good movie, and I recommend for older children to adults as there is a lot to take in and the younger generation may not understand all the discussions.  
Any adventurer, hiker, outdoorsman would enjoy this film.  
When I heard that most of Walt Disney's classic films were "Going back into the Disney Vault," I knew that I had to hurry up and try to order a few that I had grown up with.  
I had everything on VHS and now am converting over to buying all the Disney DVD's before I have children.  
I heard the book is phenomenal, and I have yet to read it.
We only have a shower, and have limited storage at our place.
I never cared for the beast, or his situation, one he was cursed with not because he was a victim, but because he deserved it in the first place.
I had to go back to my sister's and comparethem side by side.
She loves it and uses it a lot.
This show still holds up very well in my presence as it appeals to all ages including animation fans who hold it a place in their hearts.
But -- hey, that's the way things were a millennium or so ago.  
Ursula is one of Disney’s best villains.  
Which brings me to what I said in my title: This movie can be viewed by kids but some of the younger and impressionable ones (ages 3, 4 and maybe 5) may find it a bit scary at times.
The Mac truck was ordered because we lost our original Mack, a covered semi truck.  
This series of Disney animation was surprisingly adult-themed and drawn.  
This is a fun story still.
Appparently I was one of those who bought the doll from this particular Amazon listing thinking I am buying the Dool, the tiger and the brush.
but what is at all realistic about this movie?
I used this for cake toppers and then toys after, My Child LOVED it!
Monsters Inc. is much better than Monsters university.
Mine is for a 3-year old and I don't see anything that will be easy to break or rip off.  
Great family movie!
The kids wanted them for trading purposes, and in that capacity they were great.  
There are plastic "treasures" buried under  "ocean" pellets and you have to find six treasures that match the corresponding cards to win the game.
My nieces were glad to see all the Disney characters together in that one.
There is some historical background in the oral and written sources on the Viking Sagas and Arab Written stories.  
There Alice meet the White Rabbit, Mad Hatter, March Hare, Queen of Hearts, Tweedledum & Tweedledee, and the Cheshire Cat and has the adventure of a lifetime.
I bought these princess shoes for my 6 year old daughter for her birthday.
We Baaby Boomers were brought up on Disney's version of back woodsman, congressman and hero of the Alamo, even thought by historical accuracy standards, Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Crockett is closer to what he was really like.  
and i would like to see anthor movie come out
I think they should be a great addition to the castle.  
OMG I loved this movie because disney released it in the US and it's got Racoons balls in it!
They do not fit well in the crow nests etc.  
The Northmen fight several battles and are ultimately victorious, but their king Buliwyf, dies in combat.
This is a TWO DISC set.  
She's normally scared of the big tub
still love it till this day.
Its good, family based, slap stick humor that keeps my kids laughing and the adults entertained.
Soft, cute, bright colors, just the right size, well constructed, and appears to be an official Disney product.
When he's completed his task, he loves to reach back and flush the toilet.
Our grandson asked us to get him a Woody for Christmas.
My son says he is buzz and zurg is his daddy.
One of them is shot several times with bloody results.
There's lot of battle sequences and small pockets of battlefield humor.  
You just have to be patient with the shaking camera and the other distracting affectations.
It is interesting that some of these dolls have joints at their elbow and allow for more positioning of arms, my daughters weren't sure what to think of that at first.
so well it's hard to not be impressed with their work.
but she loves these little figurines.  
Horrendous over acting, simpleton scenes with big name stars in trite horrid dialog.
This is one of the classic films by Walt Disney.
Really enjoyed watching it with my granddaughters during their spring break!
The ONLY wood in this product is the box.. which is NOT a carrying case as the description claims.
The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition) - Even adults like this movie.
I honestly think disney could have done a little bit better.
But mine is for collecting.
Mermaid Princess Ariel wants to live up above the ocean floor in the world of humans.
Should you wait until Disney brings it out in the US?  
My 7 yr old purchased this with her birthday money.  
But good news to all fans: The movie will be re-released in 3D on theaters on December 2012, which means that soon it could be available on blu ray again for a more accessible price.
It's beautiful and, again, classic Disney.
You'll like it!
Personly,  I like Peter Pan more.  
Lightning McQueen is a very well-rounded character and you can see his transformation from selfish moron to a caring and loyal friend.
Alice is a child who is being pressured to act and enjoy things that older children enjoy and her dream puts her into the world of childhood fun and adventure.  
Anyway the bluray is as expected, brilliant as  are all of Dieney's discs.
These are an old man (Zachary Ittimangnaq) and a young man (Samson Jorah).  
In this it would be listening to your parents but also for parents not to smother the enjoyment of life from the child or they will rebel.
My 3 and 5 yr olds love it!
I expected Flynn Rider to look more like a "Stud" and cuter like in the movie, but I guess you cannot make a doll look like the real thing in the movie.
She is of really good quality & like the others looks just like her character.  
They loved it!  
This is one of two figurines that almost broke when removing it from the package.
(And then washed and ruined them.)
They added extra joints in elbows and wrists that make dressing and undressing doll in any type of sleeve impossible.
I really like the quality of the colors in this movie.  
A cute movie, with humor for adults too.
The film has not been cropped; it absolutely appears in its original aspect ratio.
What's next?  
Those two actors (Depp and Rush) really make the series.
"Born on a mountain top Tennessee...", thus begins that great song that every boy and a few girls knew in the 1950's and 1960's.  
For $25, it's not a good deal at all, but when your kid wants one... what do you do?
My daughter loves to fix her toys and the animals aol the time.
our 2 year  granddaughter loves this movie, she just sits and watches it.
Even Michael J. Nelson from Mystery Science Theater 3000 pointed out that the film is an homage to Bert I. Gordon's The Amazing Colossal Man(1957).
Landscapes are always popular subjects for art (painted or photographed), and "Bambi" is nothing if not one huge landscape.
The film looks and sounds fantastic, but there has definitely been some tampering when it comes to the original color palette.
Old Baloo is a laid back pilot but fiercely loyal.
Love this Disney classic!  
It seems to be O.K. despite the clump of residue.
I am very glad I made the purchase.
They look stunning and this is the way they should be preserved!
This season is the greatest thing Disney has ever done.  
Wayne makes another dumb mistake (because all geniuses are stupid) and his two-year old son Adam becomes the size of a small city (small exaggeration).  
Still, the characters do return home (at least Wendy, John and Michael) and their father admits to believing the same story as a child, which I think is an important lesson for every child.
Her birthday party was Ariel.
Old series that I never watched while it was on TV.  
I gave this to my 2 year old for Christmas and she loves it.
I was expecting the original movie with a clear crisp video and audio... not the movie redone and ridiculously vibrant and ruined...
We've had it for a year now of very consistent play and everything has held up.  
I the first disc you get to hear the story meeting that went on about making Bambi; I don't know if they are the real voices or just actors.
This is good, but for I have to admit I like the Ducktales episode Masters of the Djinj significantly better.  
I think they wish his nose and buttons came off but that's only because they want to build a snowman! :)
You like Wes Anderson films or not, maybe you're white and you do?  
Same with most classic Disney movies, they keep the aspect ratio at 43.
A must see movie.
Our boy is now 2 years and 9 months old and is finally going through toilet training.
Personally, I think that it is quite pricey for it's size.
`Monsters Inc.' on the other hand was released when I was sixteen.  
So this is a cool doll
So happens, his life takes a dramatic turn as he is lead into a run down town by the name of Radiator Spring off Route 66.  
but I was able to get that off with a small hand vac.
The story and plot is lovely.
If you like the show then you gotta watch the movie ha ha
She sometimes even crawls into it with them.
This is the worst Ducktales we’ll see this side of season 2.  
but seriously, I highly recommend.
It's a nice set
You have to love the classic Disney movies.
My only benefit derived from that is to see that in fact it is always exactly the same, except for Kermit's announcing the special guest star, and Gonzo's running gag with the gong.
I didn't think a movie about outerspace and aliens could be this boring.
Clean, appropriate humor for my children.
At this stage I help my daughter do everything so it serves its purpose.
So colorful it just captures your attention while drawing you into the storyline.
So after seeing the new transfer, I can say it's better than the previous release, but still disappointing as it looks nothing like the original.
Ithought it would have been a little better than what it was.
They are all good cleanfamily entertainment.
We love this movie in our home.  
Cute puzzle, but a few things to consider...* 4 different (24) piece puzzles of my daughters favorite character* each puzzle piece is coded on the back (stars, hearts, circles, triangles) to help keep them seperated.
Beautiful, well made, plush, cuddly, great size, disney logo ...
There’s nothing good about this one.  
p.s. disney can't make bad movies
Really like this tub for my 7 month old.
With so much going on it's a must see show, I have told you some of it and that is all.
Some of the songs, notably 'You Can Fly', fits the story almost like they were written when the book was!This is a movie for the ages.
I've been waiting to get this wonderful animated classic to purchase on Blu-ray
My daughter LOVES this doll!
Ok, everyne agrees that it was stupid and silly - but who cares?
I was highly impressed.
They are cute & my 3yr daughter loves them.
I'm upgrading my collection of DVDs slowly but surely.
The guest voices by Dick Clark, James Earl Jones and the late Robert Goulet were a treat.
And we have a lot.  
I bought this over a year ago, and it is still a favorite toy.
It is great to see these older Disney movies on Amazon instant video.
Very good value.
(The cartoons are extremely well done and very appropriate for young children, but that's a different topic.)I got this for her for Christmas, so she has not seen it  yet, but I just know she is going to love Clover as much as she loves Sophia!!I can't wait to give it to her!!!
This was a gift for my grandson.  
The first Alice in Wonderland was of the younger girl and the Johny Depp is of the older girl and more for adults.
I haven't tried this item with eggs yet, but it worked great as a pancake form.  
Click on 'Listmania!'3) Then click on See 'Entire List'.
Of course, you can't compare with the computadorized high costed productions of today....but by the time it was made, PINOCCHIO got just AMAZING graphics, musics and everything!!!
This occurred in October of '57, one full year after Herb Stempel's six-week run on the NBC quiz show, Twenty-One began.
a bit less so if you've read Douglas Adams' work before viewing the film.  
The propellers move…but barely.  
The CIA (and one private individual) often use a mild form of hypnosis in order to force people to remember previous events.
Unfortunately there is an accident that puts the world in danger.
It's the best!
Whatever magnificence he had summoned for Schindler's List seems to me never to have been revived again--anyone else feel that way?  
The real-life working-class Herbie Stempel vs. the educated, upper-class Charles Van Doren is recreated beautifully here with the acting performances of John Turturro and Ralph Fiennes.
Also a lesson on not judging others by their looks or just on the word of others.
Great movies to get you into the Halloween spirit !!!
Fight With Ursula (Alternate Ending)*
Subtitled in English for the deaf.
`Tarzan' is a film that is adorable and yet somewhat disappointing at the same time.  
The first Buzz from Toy Story 1 is very durable and made tough.
Overall the movie is funny, but the ending was appalling.
It was TINY, flimsy and a piece of junk for what I was charged.  
As soon as the DVD arrived my little ones put it in to watch and listen to the music.  
I would have expected this quality for about $15, not for the amount I paid for it.  
How do you rate this product?
This was one of the earliest efforts of Hollywood to promote evolution,  However, the show was clean, witty and fun.  
holds air and is very comfortable.
Could not find it at any of the local stores.
My kids just love this movie.
Such a tiny cake for all of those people?  
Its like a memory, search and find game.
I give this 2 starts because the fins are 5-star, but everything else just doesn't work.
Likewise, the 5.1 uncompressed Audio is the equivalent of the picture in the sound department.
My grandchildren, three of them, loved the doll.
i have a little 3-Year-old niece and when she gets old enough I would love to introduce this program to her.  
This set is large and easy for my grand daughter to handle.
The real problem isn't that this adaptation dilutes or distorts the original story, it's that it just isn't a very good film -- the script is disjointed and confusing and the animation follows suit.  
The blu-ray itself is outstanding very sharp.
It was reasonable priced but towards the end it was skipping not good at all.
She had already received the set of three with Captain Hook and another one with Jake, Hook and Scully.  
I wish they would promote this movie in China.  
This doll is IT, it really looks like character, Disney takes great care to make sure it does.
I got this previously viewed because I wanted it in 3D.  I liked the 3D, but glad I didn't pay new price.  
I ended up buying it as a stocking stuffer for my son.
it takes every adult back to there childhood, it's a classic Disney movie.
I don't know about anyone else, but I'm kind of ticked off at this release.  
The headdress is adorable and comes with beautiful gemstone in it.
That being said, I don’t think this is very appropriate for younger kids and have still banned it from the house (for the donkey scene alone).  
The Litho set is awesome!!
Someone stole mine.
I bought this bag for my niece, she practise and dance ballet.
I gave it 4/5 stars because there's no Buzz.
This movie is one of my husbands favorite
Disney Mickey Mouse Clubhouse "Sing with Me" Cd Player
Came in very good condition.  
Reading Anderson's version and watching Disney's gives us the best of both worlds.
Loved the articulation!  
One of the most memorable films of the Disney label, Bambi had plenty of cute moments - but hark!
Love Johnny Depp the movie worked great.
This is a good movie with great music.
For a film trying to focus on spirituality it just seems to have no soul of its own.
The Curse of Castle McDuck:  Scrooge, the nephews, and Webby visit Scrooge's ancestral home in Scotland, only to be embroiled in a mystery surrounding Castle McDuck.  
You can't.  Take the time to buy it for someone you love.
This dress is beautiful and a nice quality.
PRINCESSES PLAYERS MAY WISH TO BE FAMILIAR WITH:~ Ariel~
My son likes playing with them,  but they are not like the ones his cousin has that are larger and more durable.
I thought my grandson would be able to use these figures in his Imaginex play factories and MU vehicles., but they have big platforms on the bottom for displaying on a shelf which won't fit in the truck or factory etc.
When Disney brought it to animation so brilliantly I had to have it.  
Heck, it's sweet for us grandparents, as well!
These are really fun, festive decorations and I would highly recommend for a Disney party.
Shame on you Disney, shame!Ok, seriously, it's a joke, I love Bambi, and all the classics, just thought I'd try to entertain a little.
make no mistake, this is still a pretty sanitized version of the man, might very well be typically depicted as more of a squeaky-clean goody-two-shoes than the man himself, but in the transference he manages to retain that usually overlooked "human" side.
And if that weren't enough, Denahi pursuis Kenai, believing him to be the bear who killed his only remaining brother.
It is a good, clean family film.
Only took us about an hour.  
Maybe it's because I watched it so many times growing up that you never truly forget such a heartfelt story in the first place.
She opened it right away and was immediately disappointed because the arrows are impossible to shoot.
A lot of action very Sospensful a joy to watch and jennfer Gardner is very striking in the part.
Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.
We saw the movie when it came out and he enjoys them even more.
I can't add anything to what all the other reviewers have said.
Heritage:  Arriving in Canada, the world tourists encounter their first children of Oberon through Grandmother, Natsilane, who is trying to teach her skeptical grandson the ways of her magic in order to face the malevolent Raven, who terrorizes the area.  
Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin could have worked with the proper direction...
If you haven't seen them either rent or buy them, you won't be sorry
The French admiral reported that the convoy had been defended by eight Royal Navy ships of the line!(The commodore of the East India Company ships received a hero's welcome and a knighthood when he got back to England.
They found it dark, scary, and fairly uninteresting.  
East Indiamen were far too valuable, and too profitably employed on their real job, to be used to hunt the minor nuisance represented by pirates.
Dory, Marlin, Nemo, Crush, and the other fishy friends are wonderfully created.
I love this movie!  
I still love this movie after repeated viewings, and having it right on the computer is great for travel.
It turns out that we didn't care much for the movie, but that has no baring on you as a seller.
I LOVE this story.
It was an ingenious concept that Jim Henson somehow pulled off.  
The fabric on these doll clothes is very stiff and feels very cheap.
Children and adults alike appreciate the role reversal - monsters who are actually afraid of children.
He likes it, mommy like it.
Charlie still wanting his father to understand, Mark unable to fathom why his son -- HIS SON! -- would cheat on a QUIZ SHOW ...
This movie is fun for little boys and parents aren't likely to be too annoyed by having to listen to it over and over again.  
TaleSpin is a great series for both children and those of us who are kids at heart.  
There's a scene where they are about to kill a pet steer to put him out of his misery, but he is fine moments later after the execution is thankfully interrupted.
He definitely falls into the quirky category, but there is so much more to his movies than that.
The only negative comment I would have is that you have to watch through so many advertisements before you can start to watch the actual video.
Actually will add the DVD to my collection.
Even the real Prince William got to marry for love!
Boy, I'm glad I did!!
This was used but it played like it should
The pieces are thick and not flimsy.
A timeless classic!
Got it because wife wanted the set in our library.
this is as official matter of historical fact.so DAVY CROCKETT: KING OF THE WILD FRONTIER is a slightly askew historical portrait.
I bought this one because it is not stiff.
Supposed to be based on a historical rumor of a milddle eastern man noted to have traveled as some sort of ambassador through out the country.
I got this for my daughter for Christmas.
The witch who came into contact with him cast a spell on him making him remain a beast forever unless by his 21st birthday he was able to find true love.
Wish Anderson would collaborate with Owen Wilson (the co-writer on this) again.  
Alternate OpeningA Lesson in FlashbacksFinding Nemo: A Filmmakers' DiscussionOuttakes & Deleted ScenesArt ReviewIf you're looking to upgrade your Disney DVDs to Blu-Ray I recommend this edition highly!Note: I was provided with this movie for review purposes.
The pellets are sealed within the game case so you will not have to worry about the pellets getting out and making a mess.
Love this movie!
**PS: It includes a glorious trailer for the new Winnnie the Pooh movie.  
As a Beauty and the Beast afficionado, I spent hours with the special features.  
I remember when this was on TV in 1987.
The story begins with Tarzan parents escaping a burning boat and starting a new life in the jungles of Africa.
Finally, it calms down yet I see this dominating blue color.
Merida is about the size of a barbie and this horse is a wee bit big
Get this one today.
I highkly recommend it!
but they are price gouging.
A great way of learning about consequences that follow every action we make, good or bad.
And no, you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it.-- wiredweird
i would recommend it to a friend.
But the concept is really neat and after the first game my daughter was able to use the gem to check her answers.  
This Disney movie has taught generations of kids about honesty, integrity and loyalty.
The wheels broke off one plane the first time my 4 yr old played with them.
It's a good thing  Amazon will take my word and take it back.
How could anyone NOT want to see a movie where Tom Selleck, Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg live together and raise a child together?I know that Three Men and a Baby came first.  
Looks so much like character from show.
This was my 4th viewing of this oddball cult classic.  
However, despite "Beauty and the Beast" not having the same impact on me the way it impacted everyone else, I am fairly respecting it nowadays, to watch occasionally.
And there is Calypso, Goddess of the Sea.
The enchantress realizes that the Prince selfish, coldhearted and unkind and put a spell on the castle and the residents who live their as well.
Even more impressive is the lack of any modern CGI, which may dazzle but usually distracts from the story.
Disc 3 has "Top Gun" which is about Launchpad who must try to impress his family by proving he's not a dork as the Beagle boys has plans.
Part of Her World: Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (HD, 4:45).
Ok so glad I won this movie ....
And as for Leslie Nielsen "rarely cracking a smile" during this series, what did the critic expect, that it would be like "Airplane"?
I purchased this to complete my collection, 100% complete!
THANK YOU again. :-) :-)
Disney gives audiences another opportunity to experience the touching tale of Kenai with their 3-disc Special Edition Blu-ray collection of "Brother Bear" and "Brother Bear 2."
It still is funny to me and heartwarming.
However, not for me.
Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers is one of my favorite cartoon.
This is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy.  
The direction is as good as anything Anderson has done before or since and the story balances on the cusp of sadness and triumph throughout, not giving anything away until the very end.
But I still don't think that absolutely all the marvelous features from the wondrous laserdisc of Alice have all been included on any DVD or Blu-ray.
i received the item as described and I received it fast
I usually stay away from polyester & prefer all cotton bedding & linens.  
It's a great transfer and even if you don't have children or frequent young visitors, by time it comes back out of the vault again you probably will.
This is a good bag for a young dancer, big enough for a leotard and dance shoes and a few other items.
What went wrong?  
Best of all, we SCTV fans get two more legends to enjoy, now Andrea Martin and Catherine O'Hara play lady moose who are wooed pathetically by the goony moose we met in the first film, again voiced by Moranis and Thomas.
I bought this for my 19 year old daughter for Christmas as she requested one!  
My kids will be surprised.
but I decided to go ahead and buy the film on blu ray disk and also get a better standard DVD version also, and I saw the Three disk Diamond Edition right here on Amazon and I thought it would be a great choice to cover me and my familys love of this Disney
Wonderful Wonderful!!
My two year old niece received this for Christmas and is absolutely in love with it.  
The best part of Pinocchio is Pinocchio himself.
She has enough room in this tub to sit, play w her toys, and move around.
The vividness is appropriate for a story set in a fantastical world.
The film involves George, Ursula and George Jr. living peacefully in the jungle when word reaches to George that Ape has money troubles in Las Vegas and George, Shep and Tookie-Tookie heads to Nevada to help out.
if those two were not in the movie then i think it would of sucked.
Al Pacino's character cannot defiantly run his version of the report on YouTube in this era.
it's a great piece of cinema and if you buy it, it will become a guilty pleasure at 3 o'clock in the morning.
It was used so maybe the seller should've checked it out before selling it!
Things die and they stay dead...
[End Update]
I'm sure the DVD version also has improved picture and sound quality, but the songs aren't worth a quality boost anyway.
It worked great and is still in use today.
Solidly built, Buzz has taken a few tumbles down the stairs and has held up well.
Overall very happy with it.
My daughter absolutely loves this tub.
The Jungle Book II2.
If you like great original plot and dialogue, search elsewhere.
I'm not sure we ever find out why Dory can read, but I suppose she went to school.
The logic break with the talking dog at the end (if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about) brings it down a notch but not much.  A-27.
It's Beauty and the Beast, need I say more?
The story is told and sung by Dinah Shore.
My 5 yr old loves this movie.  
Some of the voices work very well, too, with the likes of Ed Wynn and Sterling Holloway fitting the animated characters quite well.
He locks Pinocchio in a cage, tells him that he's going to be helpful in making a lot of money, and then as he gets too old, Stromboli plans to turn the puppet into firewood.
If you think you got it right, you use the big red jewel to receive the answer.
It works alright, I suppose.
I bought this as a gift for my parents who "have it all" and are difficult to shop for.
I thought this was a unique episode.  
It is very cute.  
Oh yeah, and did I mention that right before he was killed, Elizabeth (who had been made pirate lord, lady, or whatever after the Chinese guy was killed quite randomly and abruptly) had to tell him that,
This is one of the best Disneys of all time and it's definitely worth having it on blu ray.
Lo, there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning.
I originally owned the VHS version of this
I tried to clean it, and in the process, I messed up the bottom of the toy.
101 Dalmations IIVII.
This is good.
Love Captain Jack Sparrow and all the other characters in the first 3 and I'm anxious to watch this one.
I love the Proud Family Movie.
I really makes me feel younger.
My son will be so excited on Christmas.
Now we have ordered them all except one!
SAMR CHILD AND PARENTS COMMENTSI GUESS
My daughter wears a size 10.5 in kids shoes.
He visits them frequently in secret to listen to Wendy's tales about himself and his adventures in Neverland.
This movie is a good movie, would not really recommend it for little kids because of bambi's mother dying but for a little bit older kids 7-10 it is a good movie.
Great movie to watch at those times when you're just feeling fed up with the rat race and want to get away without actually having to jump through all the technical and material hoops to do it.  Get it!
There's even a scene where they all go over a cliff!
I've even played this for three macho guys who sat through the whole movie amazed at the effects!
May be for kids, but it is a fun movie to watch with them!
Also, I found this for a lot cheaper at Walmart and Target.
However, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear so he can stay with Koda.
No I am not a pod person I just never watched this movie"Finding Nemo" really is a touching story about a father named Martin (Albert Brooks) doing whatever is possible to find his son Nemo (voice Alexander Gould) who has been taken to Sydney Harbor.  
Bonus Features:This is a 2-disc BD set that its full of chocked full goodies.
It's mad nice, and it's all special agenty.  
As a retired corporate officer I understood, at least to some degree, the pressures felt by those at the top as they struggled to keep a company viable.
I liked her quirkiness and sass in the first movie, now she is just overtly annoying.  
Still nightmares aside the morale of the story is sure to put your little ones on the right path in life!
Ignore the naysayers.
Another quotable movie to me.
The reason he is fired, is because he finds out that the company has placed some illegal substances in their products.
Her female Dachshund has puppies & they race to the Vet to have them delivered.
I have always loved star trek my whole life.
my son loves getting all the cars and he thought it was great to get the leader of the bad lemons
Other than her head, which swivels, Berry does not have any moveable parts.  
In this set you have the chance to watch Greg Weiss introduce each episode to you personally and give you details and little informative secrets that to a Gargoyles fan, like me, are very important and means a lot.
Upside is that I got to see these wonderful people in their prime and how much joy they brought to the world of entertainment.
This movie provides a blu-ray disk for at home, a DVD for a laptop or friend's house, and a digital copy for the road.
Colors are deeper and there are no more artifacts.
Excellent casting, fun returning characters, and answers to some of the unanswered questions from the opening story.
I hesitated because it is a bit pricey, but decided to buy anyways because of the good reviews.
Strangers Like Me Music Video with Phil CollinsB.
With Docent Audioii.
It is a visually stunning film.  
We love it, our kids love it.
This is the widescreen version tho which I didnt realize at first.
I always love a story about all working together toward a common goal.  
Not gonna lie it's not my favorite Pixar movie, but I'll still watch it.
It seems as usual, companies are doing the bare minimum when moving a movie to Blu-ray.
I enjoyed it as much as she did.  
If you love this movie the way I do, you know the rest of the line of the title.
This is ART!
The cartoon mouse was named after Mickey Rooney who gave voice to the grown-up Tod from Fox and the Hound.
The Little Mermaid holds a special place in my heart for two reasons.
It provides more options for people who may not have a Bluray player in every room with a TV, or when you bring the movie to someone's house not knowing what format they can support.
She could recline a little bit and feel supported in the tub, if she slid, she was cushioned.
The soft animation is awesome, bright colors, sexuality is cute and the philosophy behind the film is deep.
This may have working in theaters, but it doesn't seem to work on TV the same way.
The pieces are just the right size for their little fingers.
I would recommend this movie to anybody.
Inside Walt's Story Meetings - I really enjoyed watching this.
Fortunately, Criterion has given us this bluray which is a revelation.
Great movie for kids of all ages.  
I've watched several times, which is unusual for me.
I felt as though I was in the ocean and even more connected to the story than before.  
But aside from that, the picture is very clear and it is loaded with extras.
Well the blu-ray transition is another homerun from Disney.
She loves Prince Eric.  
A great villain & a great script make this is a high point of the series.  
but the little stuff should be put away.
Best of all is the price.
The replacement better be new.
My favorite multi-part story so far.
And it's just the right size for her to cuddle with at night.
its a keeper for sure .
I already had this movie in DVD but I love it so much I decided to purchase the blu ray version.
Overall a fun and hilarious ride!
But also, how much control these companies have over media.
The kids loved it also, laughing at something funny and sitting up and taking notice when it got serious.
Fantastic movie once again by Pixar and no one is more ready than I am  for Monsters University.5 Stars
Amazon has a statement about needing "active shutter glasses".
is my daughter's favorite  movie.  
I call myself the canary in the coal mine--my reactions can be a clue to other people, too!
It tries, but it should have been longer instead of wasting half of the episode to…  C+51b.  Take Me Out of the Ball Game:  This.  
He is plush, so he is soft and cuddly.  
You technically get a "full screen" , but it's with Disney View.
He's made to look a little worn like in the movie and he smells like strawberries :-)  
If your Familiar with Japanese culture this is such a great film.  
Buy this directly from Disney at retail!
There really are some lol moments.  
Some good extras here, some are repeats from the original DVD version.  
This movie, although this version is the original is filled excitement and humor, very relaxing to look at, highly recommended.
I expect this akin to heresy but I didn't much like this film.  
Okay, so maybe this isn't a 5-star production but it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve all the 1- and even 2-star ratings that are on here and many reviews aren't even accurate descriptions of the product.
I picked this film up to round out my Miyazaki collection.
Overall a great little set.
The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I've read the book so many times, I find it distracting that the story line doesn't follow the book.  
Seriously, who could not love this show??
The poster for Brother Bear has the humorous tagline "Nature Calls" with Kenai looking down lovingly at Koda.
The story begins when two apes show remarkable love for their child who is soon killed by a leopard.
Great for kids and a disney classic for everybody.
Beauty And The Beast: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack Soundtrack Edition (1991) Audio CDwonderfully pushes the tale along as Gaston aspires to rev up the villagers to rid them of the Beast.
I like movies that are both serious and comical.
Making Noise: The Art of Foley- Art Review-
what it depicts is American history as a certain generation or two wanted to think it had been.
There were some cute parts, and it was amusing enough to keep me entertained.
For the people who are nit picking about the quality of the DVD transfer that's not an issue at all because I mean if it was good enough back in the day for us as kids then I'm sure its perfectly fine for our kids.
If you are looking for much in the way of development, you may be disappointed.
However, while it is shrinkwrapped and unopened, there was no outer artwork which is standard in Disney dvds.
Actors Giving Voice To Animalsd.
Trust me, I did.
The animation is outstanding and when we had our first movie scratched and destroyed in our last move, we went ahead and bought a second copy to keep in our collection.
In my 2002 DVD review, I talked about how beautiful the animation was and how well-painted the backgrounds were but after watching this on Blu-ray, I'm going to focus on how vibrant the colors are, how well-defined the lines are, how  detailed the backgrounds to the simplest of objects such as wood, leaves and objects are.  
Hamalei Plantation Resort, Kaua'i, Hawaii.
My only complaint is the bag itself.
Nemo directly and deliberately disobeys his father and gets kidnapped as a result; Marlon overcomes many a ''hardship'' along the way and ''grows'' into a ''better'' father figure upon his reunion with his son; but first, we needed two fake outs in which the film expects us to believe that Nemo's either dead or dying, the second one followng an arbitrary climax.
I would not have bought this knowing it was a bedspread and a very very thin one at that.  
It has my favorite Disney heroine ever, the independent strong willed Belle, along with the complex Beast and a host of great supporting characters, some of the best songs ever in an animated musical (or maybe in any musical period), and is wildly entertaining, enchanting, and emotionally riveting from beginning to end.
I'm new to the Cars movies and am now a big fan of Lightening McQueen and Mater.
Peter Pan is one hour and sixteen minutes and was released in theaters on February 5, 1953.
and looks just like the one from the movie, excellent!
She carries it around in the house like its a purse sometimes.
As for Audio, it is flawless as well.
It happens offscreen, but it's obviously something which could disturb small children.
(I guess that might make Hook like Reggie).In a way, Peter isn't so much a child who doesn't want to grow up, he's an adolescent who doesn't want puberty to hit, much as today;s young boy whose voice is changing might keep choosing video games over girls until nature takes its course (though he never gives up the video games even as an adults).
It makes the characters look alive.
They are cute, well made and my daughter loves them.
You can read the other potty seat reviews I've written - we haven't had much luck with some fancier, more expensive potty seats - this was purchased as a spur of the moment, I can't stand the horrible munchkin deluxe seat, that replaced the awful summer infant three in one, which in retrospect was better than the munchkin product - but still useless.
Tim Allen is absolutely hilarious in this series with his "more power" and his signature grunts!  :)
There's no way you can fill it up and then carry it to the laundry room by the handles, for example.
Arguably Bill Murray's best work.  
Aquariums: A collection of short-loop ocean floor screensavers.
I have a blu-ray player and I was able to get this movie at a great price.
Baby Adam is very cute,and an excellent addition to the family.
Having to switching them and doing the Velcro on it.
My kids love this show! - was nice to be able to get OSO for them to play with while they watch the show (DVR).
I also pass on those bland uninteresting Phil Collin songs.
The film revolves around the main character of Arthur Dent (played by Martin Freeman as per Imdb).  
The sizing is a bit weird though as they really only fit 2-3 year olds and not beyond that.  
How can you not love the Little Mermaid, Flounder & Sebastian?!
my girls love the movie its a little short but they love it...princess and all...i am going to have to buy them more.
It also brings Sylvias' character more into play, Baby Mary's mom.
She is very protective of her lego buildings and after a month it is still complete and she plays with it often.  
The Witches' Council which Marnie approaches with her idea is initially reluctant to give their consent because the members are fearful as to what might happen should the Knights of the Iron Dagger find out.
A must see for kids.
The movie is a wonderful look back at a time when we as a people were so much more trusting and innocent.  
Montage is hilarious!
My only complaint is that her feet/ankles were small/weak, which did not allow me to stand her on her own.  Bummer!!!  
The storyline keeps laying gut-busters into the heroine.
She's get it right now, but we will wait until her parents are ready.
...and one of my favorites!
Among those lending assistance as they reach their destination--the East Australian Current  are a comically clever school of moonfish(John Ratzenberger), and the cool, surfer turtle Crush(Andrew Stanton--one of my favorite characters in the story), who encourages Marlin to give his son more independance when the reunite, an example Crush sets with his own son Squirt (Nicholas Bird).Rove McManus plays a cocky crab who finds himself compelled to assist Dory and Marlin.
I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  
It is an extraordinary saga of mammoth proportions which keeps the audience on the edge of their collective seats!  
My granddaughter loved this vacuum!
She loves it!
And since the television ratings were the real score, not the scores of the contestants, it made sense to everyone involved to rig the show with preordained outcomes.
That's a rarity.
I do not have to load and unload my car with all of these products.
Michael Mann does a yeoman's job directing this film - every frame betrays the hand of a master at his craft (or art if you prefer).  
We need that in our world today!  
I've also learned you have to get them when you can, or you'll miss out.
Perhaps I shouldn't unveil the "spoiler" about Shame and Peaches, but those of you who plan to see this movie will probably figure it out.
Product arrived very quickly in well packaged material.
Always a favorite in our house.  
The witch in the beginning turns everyone, even innocent children like Chip into household items and possibly going to let them live like that forever?
It was a gift from my youngest; she loved the movie; I loved the extras.  
Monsters, Inc. is Pixar's most funny film.
However, the latest Blue-Ray CD is now out so I got those to give to them as gifts.  
I liked the movie I had to see the it due to I have the rest now i have to buy it for the collectioni have nothing bad to say
Long ears are so cute and soft.
The DVD was scratch-free and the movies and special features played perfectly
Bambi's First SnowGames & Activities1)
I remember seeing that in I-MAX theaters in Charleston back when I was in 7th grade.
This is much better than another version which I bought which was plastic and the stickers peeled after a few months.
It's inflatable.
Just do it.
These days however, it has literally enshrined itself a place in cinematic history as one of the major achievements in animation as well as the 1940s in general.
I paired it with the princess faucet cover and now bath time is super fun and super cute!
I definitely wouldn't let a 14 year old watch this movie.
There are several ships involved, including the Black Pearl, the Flying Dutchman, a few other pirate ships (including some Chinese, French, Arab, etc.), and a huge number of British Navy.
The doll came in looking exactly like the picture shown.  
Anyone who says otherwise is inventing flaws in their mind.  
The three go into look and feel of "Beauty and the Beast" and what they wanted to achieve.  
This is one of the true gems in classic animation, and one not to be missed.....
At this, Stromboli becomes furious, and locks the puppet in a cage.
She loves that hes small enough to fit on her shoulder.
Talk about cute as heck!!!  
It is now a goal of mine to own all of the Disney classic movies, as I think it is Disney's best works.
Thanks for reading!
My daughter really wanted this doll and we got it at Disney Store.
Good BR and packaging is what  you would expect from a special addition with bonus features, dvd copy, digitial copy.
His "wisecracking" attitude wore thin almost immediately.
bought this on black Friday as a gift for my wife.  
She weighs 25 lbs.
Each disc contains one of the movies.
I enjoyed watching Peter pan as a kid and I still do.
In the late 80s, a new management team at Disney helped lead the venerable studio to a renaissance of animated films.
"Sweet Duck of Youth" has Scrooge and others to Florida to the fountain of youth, "EarthQuack" has Scrooge with the kids traveling down underground to find out that some creatures are the cause of Earthquacks, next is "Home Sweet Homer" where Scrooge and the boys are expected to meet Donald until they are whisked away to ancient greek times, "Bermuda Triangle Tangle" has Scrooge and the boys trying to find a lost peanut-butter supply ship in the legendary Bermuda Triangle to solve the mystery and finally "Microducks from Space" has tiny aliens that bring great gifts but accidently shrink Scrooge and the kids.
Watch it in Blu-ray!
but i think this movie is better than the episodes...
Bambi (Two-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging) is a classic Disney movie that has one of the most sad moments of their movies, i.e., the death of Bambi's mother.
Thank you!!
The studio's 10th effort Melody Time is a charming group of short subjects worthy of a place in any Disney fan's library.
So many reviews, just wanted to add my rating to the overall score and put in a word for the one that started the whole fairy tale cartoon revival with the music as one of the main features of the story.
A fabulous score/choir accompanies the great artwork.  
This mini documentaries include design of characters, settings, graphics, animation and more.  
Cars is a classic though, and certainly one of the best, if not the best Pixar film.
DuckTales is one of my favorite cartoons for my childhood.
Great for the whole family!:D
Have been wanting to get this movie for awhile to add to my disney movies.  
The building of the story-line as he learns to be a good person and give to others is a good lesson to learn, and pretty well done.
and I always get the correct gift.
Colors are rich, skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep.  
Also This was the best thing Garner did in my opinion.
Of all the feature films Walt Disney personally produced, "Alice in Wonderland" is one of the best.
It's quite different.
The little thing hanging from the front of the crown is held on by a little hook that does not secure to anything, so by swinging it quickly it will fall off.
Sent on a mission to study wolves that he is ill prepared for he manages not only to survive but embrace this desolate landscape along with the animals and few humans that live there.  
You get only one, not two!
The dozens of alien races look magnificent, the competing spacecraft are wildly varied and thoroughly interesting, the guide itself is a note-perfect modernization of an aging concept, and the infamous factory on Magrathea is jaw-droppingly realized.
My 6 year old daughter has a collection of these little Palace Pets.
Classic Bruckheimer, enjoyed the special effects just like the others.
The leader of the warriors at first blush appears to be just another "Gnorts the barbarian" type... but we get a hint that he is far deeper when we discover that he is interested in literacy... but so much else on the cutting room floor... including the fact that his father was a carpenter....
Nice to know Christmas can be simple and a success.
The quality of the film you get is ok.
She has had this puzzle for almost a year now and has done it tons of times and it's still intact, with no torn pieces.
Although it's snapped together pretty solidly, when I put my daughter on it, she seat really sunk in toward the toilet water a bit, enough to worry me too much to keep it.
The gargoyles are blamed for stealing the "Eye of Odin" after Matt and Elisa see a gargoyle shaped figure stealing it.
I grew up watching W.D.
Can't wait to see our grandson's eyes when he opens his gift Christmas Eve.
Little scary with the sharks.........and the villainess.........good to explain some of this to the younger ones..............
Grandson loves them all, but cries everytime this Buzz breaks
The photography was sensational, the wolf scenes are very believable, and the transformation of a person lacking wilderness experience into someone capable of surviving on his own is honest.
The Insider a riveting story that takes on a new dimension in light of where we are now, and where we need to go.
The large size got her excited when the puzzle was finished.
I purchased this puzzle for my toddler this afternoon.  
I'm disappointed that they did not record the songs that were featured in the books written by Deborah Gregory (Welcome to the Glitterdome, Wannabe Stars in the Jiggy Jungle, Shop in the Name of Love, More Pounce to the Ounce, It's Raining Benjamins, etc.) because I'd really like to know how the author intended for them to sound, but the songs that are included in the film are great as well.
We are big fans of clean, good family flic's!
They're really cute, but the Mickey got all demented in the dryer.
my son watched this about a kathousand times.
In the original book, Tarzan (Lord Greystoke) returns to London, and then comes back to the island later.
If you like stories of the wild frontier -- you'll like this!
If you liked this, read the others because they're meant to play off each other.
You will not regret, better quality than walmart.
However we didn't get the one pictures.
It is neat to be immersed into the pirate world and journeys.
This is a great animated series and I highly recommend it.
Then came TV...at first it was family stuff, but as it evolved it grew and grew and grew some more until now there are so many options it's hard to decide.
Great movie to snuggle up with my grandkids on a rainy day--heck, even in the middle of summer it's a great movie to watch!
Great family show for all to watch.  
the ears will not stay put, the folding floor piece is cardboard with a plastic frame, so it never fit 'right'.
Good quality, clean, and nothing over the top.
I got this in a fit of nostalgia and don't regret it one bit.
I will enjoy seeing it this Christmas and for many Christmases in the future.
After a few months of using it every other night, I have only had to re-inflate it once to make it firm again.
It shows young girls that diversity exists.
This hard to find movie was finally found used.  
I think maybe he would have liked it more if there was some singing in it, but I thought it was great.
I also like that this Lotso bear "looks" worn out and rough.
;)D. The hair accessories are very cheap.
It doesn't look like it would last forever, but it looks like it will last much longer than I need!  
The way they used to make movies!
It's Disney and very few of them are bummers.
I have also read that there is a tiny edit of the word
but the first disc is EXTREMELY scratched up, it isn't like the description.
Amazon was a good choice, made my Christmas shopping easy & fast!
I have it in dvd but, it easy to watch while husband watches football.
but Im not sure if I would by them again or even recommend them to a friend.
The Jungle Book 2III.
I bought this set to use as a cake top decorations & it was perfect.  
She just loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.  
When I got these I was hoping  my kids would be able to use them in their pirates ship, I was wrong.  
One of her childhood shows she used to like watching.
Although he didn't travel the globe as part of Team Lightning (hey, someone had to stay behind to sprinkle the flowers!), he did give them an emotional farewell at the airport as they headed to Tokyo, and ended up coming to London to help talk to Mater and blast away at some of the "Lemons" during a heated battle.
soft & I love that the flat sheet has a fitted bottom, it actually stays on the bed even though my toddler tosses and turns.  
but I assure you this is not some super duper christian morals review or some right wing conservative view.
My 4 year old loves this toy!
And again, even with regard to the plot, it is not heavy-handed here, and it wasn't until now, so many years later, that it occurred to me that the plot was really an "anti-fairy tale", something that I've grown to hate.
Original Theatrical Trailer* Deleted Scene: "Fathoms Below" Alternate Version* Deleted Scene: Backstage with Sebastian* Deleted Scene: "Poor Unfortunate Souls" Alternate Version* Deleted Scene: Sebastian Lost in the Castle* Deleted Scene: Advice from Sebastian* Deleted Scene:
The other doll if you want to find use the keywords: deluxe, princess and friends,designer.. as it is listed under different names.
His gives an excellent performance of a poet that evolves into a warrior.
"Pinocchio" wasn't my uber-favorite Disney movie when I was little.
Not cheap, good toys.
This item is smaller than a traditional lunch box, more the size that a puzzle would come in.  
Her face, hair and outfit are identical to the movie version of Jasmine, which is extremely important to my 3 and 4 yr old daughters.  
These shoes are very well build and the plastic they used on the shoe is duruable, which mean the shoe heel will not fall of.
The description indicates these are for the pool and bath... but they really are not.
A great old classic story done well.  
"It's hard to understand unless you're a parent.  
My family and I enjoy this movie.
An entire season for less than 10 bucks?
Can't wait to give it to them.
The opening shots have the potential to be SO beautiful, but are marred by grainy, dirty prints that seem to constantly have the color fluttering.
My son loves Monsters Inc.
It definitely stars a little weird.
This is a very unique commentary/documentary that can be played during the entirety of the film.
Falls apart constantly.
After being stepped on a few times it finally broke.
This was another cool conversion into 3D. Great movie in 2D and even better in 3D. Certian scenes are particularly enhanced in 3D.
They love to watch it over and over.
I love this movie so much - my favorite!  
But watching this new Bluray version brought back many memories for me.
Bought one of these (at separate times) for each of my grandchildren.  
"Cars" is a great looking movie as you would expect.
I had this movie on VHS from a friend and am glad to have it on DVD for my own library.  
Rating strictly 3d effects ... AWSOME!!!  
As always, the show is clean, funny, clever and creative with its situations and story lines.
Besides the movie itself, there is tons of bonus material, including a running video commentary that runs along-side the film, which tells the story of the making of the film, as well as the making of the book.
The kids will love it and watch it a few times, really cute movie.
Leaving one to wonder why the likes of Slim Pickens bothered to show up for a part that didn't really allow him to do anything.  
We wouldn't have purchased this had we known.  
Because at least Finding Nemo had the common courtesy of not being a propaganda flick like Wall-E (yeah, it toned down on the comedy, but it instead became a joyless ideological flick bent on brainwashing young children, both traits I think makes it worse).
Modern animation is very polished and impressive, but there is something organic and real about hand drawn animation that leaves you feeling warm and contented.
This one totally undelivered.
I enjoy all his movies he has made.
42.Nope. doesn't fit.
she's 13 months and 32 inches tall.
But I like everyone else fell in love with this moving
The cars set of toys and movies have been the biggest hit with my grandchildren.  
I would buy more Disney Classics or Gold if the price was as good as it was on this one.  
I like it because it comes as described.
My boy loved it.
I thought it was clever and funny, and know people who have named thier animals after characters
They say it makes them want to learn how to dive.
The Szalinski family is considered freaks on their block (they are) and their kids, especially their teenage son Nick, are embarrassed of what their family, more precisely their father, has become.  
In "high concept" movies like "The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes", "The Strongest Man in the World", and "Now You See Him, Now You Don't", Dexter would be subjected to wild, crazy plots where he would, respectively, gain super-intelligence, super-strength, and invisibility powers.  
Bought as a gift but as expected it was very cute and the person receiving the gift loved it!
I can't wait for new grandaughter to watch it with me.
STILL LOVE THIS MOVIE!  
my 5yo daughter loved this game!
She's not really posable and sort of stays in that leaned forward position.
I loved the disc art and wasn't too happy when they took that away in favor of the blue and white discs for blu-rays and silver for the dvds.
I love Zipper, just like I love all the Rangers, & this is an excellent spotlight for him.  
You can spend 10 minutes trying to get all the water out of these things and then still be worried that mold will form on the inside.
He was delighted to get all of these and has played with them every day since.  
Worth the buy if nothing else than to hear the strong, hypnotic voice of Keith David.)
I recommend it.
The following scenes, as rendered on Blu-ray, are really among my most pleasurable visual experiences of all time, not just counting stuff I saw on a tv screen:*
digital is always good if we're out on the road.
Very roomy for baby to splash and play with bath toys..Easy to reach baby for bathing ..Easy to remove baby after bath..
Based on a british miniseries, an average guy and his old girlfriend become the last two people from Earth alive.
Several weeks ago, I joined the Disney Blu-Ray Movie Club.
It's okay, but not completely appropriate for a toddler.
This doll is beautiful.
Take the ball room scene, with its sweeping camera shots and the chandelier, with our heroes dancing underneath on a marble floor with gigantic windows.
Brother Bear reveals to the audience what it means to be apart of a community regardless of species.
It is hard to see the horrible things that evil people did to their fellow humans, but the compassion and goodness of others is so amazing.
Must have for any 80s generation kid or adult.
Will give a 5/5 rating on seller.
It's like a little bonus when I can watch those movies and bond with my daughter.
Wish Disney would stop killing off parents in their movies.
We then move to the days in which Nemo is now a young, playful and happy clownfish.
The film has everything you want.  
A member of the former Soviet Union sent to the US to infiltrate and betray the CIA, Irina married Jack Bristow and then faked her own death to fool the government... but not until after murdering twelve of the CIA's top agents.
This turns into a Secret Service car style plan between the two groups to decide who is better.
I'm personally partial to all of the instances where an oblivious Mike Wazowski, a role seemingly custom made for Billy Crystal, narrowly avoids fame but is no less enthusiastic about it.
This is a heroic fantasy, a quest to destroy what turns out not to be a fire serpent as they thought but an army of cannibal bear-men living in caves.
I would recommend this to any family who wants a film the parents would like and will also captivate the children.  
WE took them with us to the Disney show and they were very happy with them.
From the animation to the songs to the story and voice acting this movie is near perfection.
Ordered & sent back, needed bigger tub.  
My son was a little hard on it, but not any more rough than he is with all of his other toys, which are still intact.
As a previous reviewer said, "it never picks up".  
hey, dick van dyke is a lot of fun, don't get me wrong, but this movie is quite a cliche'd story.  
Everyone in my family really enjoyed this movie, with its clean humor, good animation,and silliness.
The kids have had a great time with the figurines in this package.  
This is but one of the many magical movie momentos from Walt Disney Studios---I feel this is a must for a younger audience: those who would like to throw the pillows on the floor, dig into a big bowl of popcorn and take off for parts unknown on an adventure of a lifetime........
these are cute and my son plays with them a lot, but they are very small and flimsy.  
A little girl was in danger and no one was around to help.  
All in all a pretty fun film.
But despite some similar themes, this movie is not much like "Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind" or "Princess Mononoke" (both among my favorites as well.)
It's particularly odd coming from a producer whose films traumatized children with scenes that cut to the core of their deepest fears -- in particular, the separation of a child from its mother, of which "Bambi" remains the prime example.
Overall its a pretty cute game involving imagination,  puzzle solving, and play acting.
if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
It had been some years since I saw this movie so I grabbed it so I could be ready for Monster University.
This movie documents the lives of two of the artists that worked at Disney for many years and created the characters and stories we loved as children.  
Thanks for your great service and quality product.
Unlike most Disney Classics Blu-rays, the default on Alice is stereo Dolby Digital.  
The soundtrack is one of a kind and fits the entire movie like a glove.
Her outfit is nicely detailed and doesn't have accessories/adornments that will flake off or become MIA.
She's had her eye on these for a while, but they are not to be found in the disney stores around here.
The more I look into this story, the more I see it that way.
Yet another good movie to add to our collection of movies.
"Alice in Wonderland" was also almost the first Disney animated feature until "Snow White" was ultimately selected.
I wouldn't hesitate to buy a used DVD since it's much cheaper than a new one
Peter Pan arrives at the children's nursery to find his shadow.
Oh I am 31 years old
Grandkids loved them.
I was nervous about whether the monsters would scare her, but this issue is handled very tactfully, and in my opinion, there are only 2 times when monsters do something scary (roar), and it is either immediately followed by something silly that makes the monster look ridiculous or contrition on the part of the monster.
It was breathtaking.
It fit her perfectly, but I'm skeptical it would fit a child much older than 5yo very well.
This fits perfectly over my tub faucet without obstructing the water flow from the tap and I love that I can still pull the shower pull without difficulty.  
This movie will perpetually be out so you will want to get it before they lock it away again.
We love Pixar movies and Monsters, Inc. delivers--it is adorable and funny.
The puzzle is NOT wood as the description above claims.
My ancesters were Vikings (my wife calls me a barbarian) so I enjoyed this one very much.
The film arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  
I will definitely buy from this seller again.
Sometimes smudges or colors that aren't alike in certain spots from the manufacturer.
The movie is one of disney's best film to see.
My daughter loved it.
It's a shame there aren't many good people like this in the real world.
The excised song - "Human Again" - is seamlessly re-integrated into this Blu-ray (you can watch the "Original Theatrical Version" or the "Extended Version" which includes the new song).  
Monterey Jack's best episode.  
this is a great gift, especially for the price
Highly recommend this movie.
There wasn't much depth to this story either.  
I cannot itemize every element to assure that the edited material was placed elsewhere on the Blu-ray, so again I'm keeping my earlier edition.
I've felt sorrow for the sad reality.
nice and shinny,  little funny looking but that was what made me smile about him when we got him for our 3 year old who loves the movie and is a true Tom Boy.
Out of her element.
Good ol movies like this are a thing of the past.  
Also, it is not as violence-free as we would have liked it, and frankly, would have expected it for a Disney production.
Wonderful, funny, clever, just the right mix for kids and adults.
Get it for your little ones today.
yea, it really is a great sci fi movie.
I know, I know, you're rolling your eyeballs - but hey - talk about an adorable chick!
Product looks good.
First let me say, this is a great plush.  
She absolutely loved them.  
Squeezing it is not enough; you have to bend the bottom of the toy to get all of the water out to prevent mold growth.
With various written adaptations, the difficulty was trying to take the original 1865 novel and bring it to life via animated.
It was exactly what i needed it to be and everything i expected.
Every child would want to remove the shoes and see her cute little feet or toes.  
The film shows Pixar's growth and each film looks more polished that the one before it.
Disney had two different dolls, the one with accessories and the one without.
all disney movies are the best!
It is a great movie that is fun and fresh.
I love this film.  
I think it deserves to be added to every little kids disney movie collection.
And a fine featurette it is, too.
I have even looked at other providers only to find;
The monsters are just too ugly to be funny; or too funny to be so ugly.
They are average quality.
I watched this growing up and must say these are still WAAAAAAAY better then any of the new cartoons out there!!!
However, a clean and vibrant picture outweighs all that in my opinion.
We have worm out the others.
There was a particularly memorable one where the sea life goes into song and dance, and it was a lot of fun to watch.
Ahhh that's what I get for letting her wave
She has so much fun with it I just ordered her another one!!!!
Great stuffed toy.
Pinocchio (Disney Gold Classic Collection) is one of the best animated movies that I have ever seen.
This film isn't guaranteed to effect most people in the same way it did me, because most people dont have that first hand experience with what the film more or less deals with, and also in an innocent way, not like in a dark foreign art house film that'd make the thing into a very dark and disturbing endeavor, here, to me and my experiences, Rushmore couldn't BE anymore realistic.
This is an action comedy that fits his style.  
So this is me years later still wanting the movie to go with the CD.
The beginning could be upsetting for kids because of what happens to Nemo's mother, so if your child is sensitive I might skip over that part.
Despite some commentators' views, the movie DOES have messages, not only of love and devotion and self-acceptance, but also about having the courage to risk altering a lifetime of conditioned thinking and behavior when it proves to be misguided.
i would recommend to adults and kids-
There is still an animation walk-through attraction at the Park, but there are no longer glimpses at working animators.
He is also searching for Demona.
She would refuse to sit on a little potty, so I needed something for a regular toilet and this worked out perfectly.
Very touching and very funny at times.  
She said it is very comfy.  
So maybe the problem isn't even the transfer, but the actual film itself.
Get it now!
Sound quality was very poor!  
Would make good birthday cake toppers I suppose.
He loves it and so do I.  What a way to bond!  
but all in all I think it's a good waffle iron.. though one of the reviews said something about the waffle iron having no setting.
My son loved it, it's a perfect size for him to take it in the car and he hasn't put any holes in it
In two cases, the case of the three fairies as well as the animal figurine, it was hard not to break the figurines when removing them from the plastic.
According to other reviewers, Mickey and the Beanstalk was a single short.
I have loved this film since the first time I saw it and re-watched it countless times, marveling each time at how each scene makes its point, reveals its characters and moves on to build a cohesive whole.
So, just wanted to let you know that info.
no circumstances watch this unless you have seen and enjoyed the first two "Pirates of the Caribbean" films.
I felt like a kid again glued to this movie from start to finish.
The car was even bigger than I thought, witch is even bettter.
For story problems and other issues, the studio halted work on Bambi (released in 1942) and production began on Pinocchio.
Some great stories continuing in the world created in season 1.
I thought it would make  a good gift for a great-great- niece.
Every character, even the peripheral ones like Big Chief and Tiger Lily, are wonderful.
My daughter actually keeps Treasure, and a few of her other Palace Pets, in her backpack to play with on the bus-ride home from school.
The Alice in Wonderland Blu-ray offers a huge jump in quality over previous releases of the film.
The sequel is not really all that culturally significant if you think about it.  
We have the Sleeping Beauty set too and it has the same problem.
It was the first time for both kiddos watching the film, but it was also my first time watching it in over 16 years, and I was surprised by how much of the film I had forgotten.  
The 3D effects will not jump out at you but adds some value to the visual experience.
Donald Applecore3) Lambert the Sheepish LionChapter Selection1)
This is an awesome movie that is universally adored by everyone in my family from the 12 yr old to the 53 yr old.
The human emotions that they are given make the final product an endearing combination that is still enjoyable some 70 years later.
Throughout the movie she was laughing and saying "silly Mater!"(So now Disney will no doubt make s movie about trains.
Very dissapointed in size and especially since a disney item
This movie set includes Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier and Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  
I have always loved Finding Nemo.  
Some of them so in need of a shotgun blast to the face.
If you feel the same way I do - buy it.
There's a sense of life and, dare I say it, realism that draws out the incredible beauty this medium can produce.
I bought this go to with the soft Merida doll (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XFD4AS/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i02) and my daughter really loves both.
This is a great movie for tweens and older, but I'd rather skip the drama for those under 7 years old.  
And beyond the technical wizardry of making it look so real, they know how to make it look pleasant.  
They also can stand up on their own, which makes them more fun to play with.
Even now, almost 25 years later this movie still holds up with timeless music and great animation.  
Much has been written on this film, some of the finest work done under Walt's direction.
I would say its good for ages 4-12.
High adventure, drama, comedy, and action come together as seamlessly as the oceanic environment we are introduced to.
Each plays a special role and each does something different.  
but she is a total sweetheart here), and the Japanese soldier characters were both excellent actors and fun characters.
They haven't used it that way much since, but they have been having a blast just using the dress up components and playing pretend together, and playing with the cards.
When he mentioned it to me recently, I searched at Amazon to see if I could find it for him, and there it was.
Gota love watching raccoon dogs fight with thier "pouches" haha this movie was a great addition to studio Ghibli...
Delicious surround-sound water noises, fabulous orchestral musical numbers, deep thunderous booms for Ursula.
The characters are well-formed, the story is full of lessons, the humor is quiet and appropriate.  
The menus are set up to first offer the NEW Bonuses (more in a minute) and then what are termed the "Classic Extras" - the ones mentioned in earlier reviews like the Making of.., deleted scenes and songs, and Roy Disney audio commentary.
Fast shipping and is at a reasonable price.
There's this sense of quirkiness to a Wes Anderson film that you can't find anywhere else and that's its charm.
He totally smells like strawberries too.
I loved this movie/musical from the first time I saw it in the Theatres.  
Can't wait for a complete collection to finally be released.
For years, we all had 4:3 (square TV's) & when we watched movies that had a different aspect ratio, we watched it with black bars on the top & bottom, in a letterbox format.
Which meant forming line of battle just like genuine warships, hoisting battle flags, running out the guns, sailing straight for the enemy, and if necessary actually exchanging broadsides with them.
It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds.
Some critics called this film "entirely unpleasant."  
Would I recommend it?
i frigin love this movie.
plus, i've always thought that dylan mcdermott looks just like prince eric, call me crazy, but i do see somewhat of a resembalance.
Such a combination is a too-infrequent find.
It's a Disney movie!  
Christmas 2011 a merrier one...
They're the only ones that I think are actually funny.  
There was only one of each, no duplicates.
This is just one of the many collectable special editions I have purchased mainly for my wife who likes to collect such things and we both loves the extra features.
This is a lovely show.
Not just for kids, if you want a "feel good" movie this is it.
Gripping drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  
Wonderful movie with talented singers and a well written story.  
They also enjoyed it!
I remember growing up watching the show and having such great memories with it.
You know you want it, so why are you waiting?
Foxx as Shame would have been interesting.
It takes elements of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass and mixes them together.  
The Kim Possible Movie is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, one of the best Disney DVD's I seen in a while.
i guess the wife bought it and ther eyou go .
The year is 1957, and everyone, it seems, is watching the popular TV game show, "Twenty-One."  
Nothing looks so bad that I would call them total trash, but it's obvious that they could have looked a lot better.
In the movie Finding Nemo by Walt Disney, Nemo is trying to find his dad and his dad is trying to find him, but on his dad's way he bumps into a girl named Dory.
Need more shows like this.  
While I realize I bought this used, this was beyond acceptable.
And now poor Lotso gets dragged all around the house and has a permanent spot in my sons bed.
It is by far her favorite.
That's my reason for 4 stars.
Already had the Minnie set, had to have Mickey as well.
It came well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.  
I ordered this movie and Brother Bear II for my 4 year old son.  
Now it seems to work sporadically.
Perhaps such portrayals might have been entertaining to little children raised on poorly written Westerns on TV but these days it's the kind of thing that could be edited from the film to positive effect.
It's a classic piece of animation from Disney, and remains a magical journey for parents and their children alike.
With this nap mat, it is much easier for her to setup her bed at nap time.  
This is a small stuffed animal but far larger than a beanie baby.
We got lots of complements on our Mickey hats.
a really fun movie I watch with the grandkids every year.
Double 'O' Chipmunks - After hurting Dale's feelings, the other Rangers indulge him in his James Bond fantasies and dupe him into thinking that he is solving a case in which he must deliver microfilm.
To stand against the East India Trading Co., Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker.
For another, she's not completely enamored with Gaston, the local huntsmen who's prowess at hunting is only small compared to his overinflated ego.  
What more can you say.  
She also looks a lot like Shelley Long.
For $10 it's worth it.  
Next she drank from the potion bottle again and became tiny to get in a tiny bottle and float safely or survive the flood.
I have to admit, that bullfighting robot is pretty cool though.  
Earrings - very poorly looking and small.8.
My son looooves his Mickey set and it's so soft :)
I find this to be an excellent film since I'm a Banderas fan.  
They are also known for taking the severed heads of their fallen adversaries.
Still, the animation is beautiful as is the use of some computer generated segments.
Thank you for such a wonderful gift.  
I recommend it to every one.
Exactly as described!
Pixar, similar to Toy Story, puts heavy duty race cars in a human light -- not one character in the movie is human.  
My 5-years-old niece's favourite character form the movie...
The ride at Disneyland makes more sense now, too --ha ha
Who doesn't love this movie.
The first act of Phase One can't be blamed on ABC portraying the show wrongly (though they did make their promo for this episode feature the first act almost exclusively as I recall), that one is on the producers and, as epic and important an episode as it it, they held it back a bit in my mind and turned a lot of potential new fans of the show off with that stunt and by post-Super Bowl standards the ratings for this episode were very poor.
It must be among other movies.
A very very good movie for kids and adults,Albert Brooks voice really helps he film.
I sat down with the grandkid to watch and it ended up with everyone "remembering when...".
It has also been a wonderful tool to show my kids what we will be doing each time before we go to the doc so they are prepared if it's a shot day.  
I sent them this one along with a few others for Easter....the only complaint I've heard is from their Mom who says "Morning, Noon & Night, it's Poohmania around here...and that's great, but I'm afraid they're going to wear out the DVD's at the rate they're going!"  Can't beat that for a positive review!  :)
I could point out many of the other scenes in the picture, but to sum it up: many people have said that the film represents "technically perfect animation."
I mean, outside of the horrendous `Cars' (I refuse to see `Cars 2'), they have had one homerun after another.  
AND...even for a kids show, I found it touching when Jasmine said: "I'll never leave you Aladdin...ever..."
Deleted song: not sure if it's the arrangement, but "Twitterpated" really sounds much too contemporary to have been included in this movie.
Not your typical Disney product.  
Got Tink to go along with Peter Pan movie for my 3 year old grandaughter,she loves faries and has Peter Pan too!
Pacino, Crowe, and Mike Wallace (yes, the one from CBS) give excellent performances.
Delightful story that takes place at Christmas time.
One of my favorites from DISNEY!!!!
You really have to season 1 first.  
Take 4 words out of it and I would give it 5 stars.
Another inaccuracy is the introduction of Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) on the 11/26/56 Twenty-One airing and Stempel's immediate departure, via "taking a dive."
what little boy wouldn't like this.
I watched this movie two times.  
For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks).  
I think that $40 is a little pricey though.
Ariel needed her prince!
Still worth watching for a light enjoyable flick that the whole family can watch.
She likes to dance to the music, good soundtrack.  
I will say that I wish Belle was a bit stronger of a character.  
Aurora,~ Belle~ Cinderella~ Jasmine~ Merida~ Pocahontas~ Rapunzel~ Snow White~ Tiana Mulan
"Miracle at Midnight" is one such film - a remarkable true story of courage and sacrifice by a well-to-do Dutch family.
Otherwise, it's quite enchanting.
I liked this movie.  
Rabbit adopts a Scrooge-like role in this story, which features original songs and overall is a very attractive production.
It's been around nearly 60 years as of this writing and I've been alive for many of those years but couldn't say I took the time to see this Disney 'classic'.
it seems to have more depth than "pop out" 3d ....
this is a great holiday movie for kids and the kid at heart.
There were a few instances where, there was lots of motion on the screen and in those couple of instances, the 3D was distracting.  
Viewing it again, none of its power has waned over the ensuing three decades.
Maybe a children's MP3 player - with good audio & music that is actually from Disney!  
such a fun disney movie for the whole family.  
YOU CAN KEEP WATCHING AND WATCHING FOR YEARS TO COME.
Both sides of this plush toy are very cute.  
I have been looking for a very long time to find this doll.
Light and Laughing!  
After a few tries, he learned how to use the little pee shield.
I Enjoyed it.
The fit on the yellow dress isn't great either.
The movie also shows Arabs is a positive light, something few movies do.
The story line is so different and enjoyable.
All in all a fun flick to watch, especially if you've seen the others.
Buy Big Brother and Big Brother 2.  
It has a Rapunzel picture on it, over and over, and the picture is kind of blurry, not to mention her lips look way too big for her face and the colors appear to be a bit faded.
The soundtrack is great--the sound effects and ambient music are crisp and spot on.
Mos Def isn't the first guy you think of as Ford Prefect and he doesn't come across as awkward as Ford is, but he is entertaining enough.
No harm, it was just a scare because I had my hands on him and pulled him up quickly.
Finally a cute baby tub that sits safely in bathtub.
I purchased this movie after a recent trip to Disney World.  
The Proud Family Movie is one of the best and most memorable Disney Channel movies to enjoy!
All you're left with after the movie ends is a sense of great appreciation for this film existing.
it's your standard figurine set all sturdy pieces that look just like the actual characters.
13 Episodes in two DVDs in Full Beautiful Color with Action Packed Animation, hours of Fun Entertainment and for such small Price! ...
This series also sparked my interest in the 'duck-verse'.
It is one of those with the cardboard slip cover and usually that is damaged in shipping, this one was in perfect condition.
That's the plot in a nutshell; it's a very authentic, exciting plot with deep themes of connection to nature, understanding above ignorance (i.e. foot on the other shoe) and forgiveness.
One reviewer I read may have been on to something when he expressed his opinion that Hollywood types today generally don't like the Revolutionary War because "1)those guys dressed funny, and 2)they were right-wing gun nuts.
Great movie, my fifth graders loved it even though it was an older movie.  
So there!Heather
Glad I bought the 3D version, with the anniversary set.
Wonderful kid movie.
But if you're getting something for a little one to snuggle and sleep with, that's actually a good thing.
It's just as cute as I remembered as a kid and with the combo pack we can watch it at home or in the car.
My kids really enjoy this movie, although we have had some tears during the shooting scene.
The Wonderful Fable about the little boy raised by Wild Animals in the Jungle Adapted from the Classic and Famous Story by Edgar Rice Burroughs, who doesn't know that one?
Chris experiences considerable difficulty with both her husband, who feels neglected, and her son, who feels embarassed.  
It definitely carries his signature humor, which tends to act as a double edged sword: If you love Adams' humor then you will enjoy this movie, if not then you probably won't.
WOW...Brings back so many WONDERFUL MEMORIES..
Because that was the entire point of the novel (and subsequently the movie) you have to enjoy it for what it is.
Well worth the time and money to buy!
What happened mother?
He sticks by Baloo's side and has a big crush on Rebecca.  
In conclusion, this game is cute in concept, but in my opinion could have been done better.
I got this for my 2 year old's Easter basket and she is absolutely thrilled with it.
She loves it just as much as her Grandma does !!!
If you have a little one that loves to do hair...YOU HAVE TO GET THIS!
"This is a movie one can watch over and over again.  
Loved the blue decorative touches on the elbows and wrists!  
He absolutely loves it.  
i got this for way less at toysrus.
You just can't beat Disney.  
VIDEO:"Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary Edition" is presented in 1080p High-Definition, Full Screen (1:33:1).  
I would definitely recommend it, although we bought it at Toys 'R Us for $24.95.  
Even THIS piece of forever great classic nostalgia.  
and he said that the 3D transfer was a little lame.
My kids love it soooooo derive from this what you will!Update:  (somewhat unrelated)
Will there be a sequel?  
In truth, it's probably a better gift for a 2 or 3-year-old.
Soooooo cute, I can't tell you how cute!
Its so cute and this doctors bag is super cute.
I'm not a huge Disney fan, and have liked only a few other films, such as Mary Poppins, but this film has ignited a possible love for subsequent Disney films.
Perfect for those movie lovers who love the movie so much they watch it til the disk burns out.
I'm not sure why they had such great designs for the other pieces except for this one.
The story boasts excellent, fully fleshed-out characters, the songs, including "When You Wish Upon A Star" and "I Got No Strings On Me" are some of the greatest numbers ever in a Disney production, and the movie presents at least five villains, if one includes Monstro.  
it's that Peter is about Peter and even his refusal to grow up can be seen as a childish refusal to follow the rules of society and nature.
The DVD presentation does the film I remember from the theater justice.
naturally after a suitable mourning period , I sent her a DVD of " The 13th Warrior".
She loves her Merida doll.
This is a wonderful fantasy story
I was looking for Monsters Inc and found the 2 disk edition on Amazon and was delighted to be able to get both of them in one unit.  
But in reality Boo is an inquisitive little girl who loves her "kitty" (that'd be Sully).  
One answer of course is that pieces of the story just leaked into my consciousness over the years.
It was this lovable reindeer.
The shipping and delivery exceeded the estimated time, super fast.  
Thanks for the speedy delivery and great condition of the movie.
My 3 year old son is in LOVE with monster trucks.
It doesn't hurt to have little things like Tom & Ray - aka Klick and Klack, the real-world car guys - helping out.
As a radio reporter, I had the opportunity to express these views to the film's director in person--so when I say that many Baby Boomers, when they first saw the ship emerge from the mists, they got the same genre-renaissance jolt that science fiction did when they first saw the rollup in "Star Wars."  
Fake me to Your Leader: Wicked Professor Nimnul invents a ray-gun that causes things to grow and uses it on some local pill-bugs in an elaborate alien invasion hoax.
We also see some very important characters such as the Red Queen and The Mad Hatter who are (and no offence to Johnny Depp I love him so much) much closer to the novelization versions the story is based upon here then in the more current movie.
Great design detail.
This is one of those well built, well designed with every bell-and-whistle toy that delivers on the promise to engage and intrigue little active minds ...
Seemed like a good idea but hard to rinse baby since she can't stand and water soapy.  
Within 2 days she received 7 Disney Princess Dolls in one package and Prince Eric.  
I bought these to use on the top of my son's 4th birthday cake.
This may not be PIXAR's finest, but it's still a good movie with loads of funny moments.
If you have never seen it, now is the time.
It's as active, and vibrant as the visuals!
It's a movie with many messages - including living life to the fullest - "no regrets".
Tim Allen's voice, of course.
Another fun Disney movie.
I bought this 90's movie for my son, who has Down's Syndrome.  
It is very touching and reinforces the values that Peter Pan really stands for.
It's just as funny and inspiring as the movie itself.
It has the effect of someone nagging, "do you get it?"  
Another exciting, fun, hilarious video that reaches all age groups.  
it came on time and at a great price!  
The string you pull to make woody talk is easy to pull so it was a great gift for a two year old.
Now I can experience a hours of fun with my 5 year old!
But the crown has a poor look to it and it too cheaply made, luckily the wand is probably worth what they charge for the entire set.
It's soft and doesn't look like it will be falling apart at the seems anytime soon.
His confrontation with Pacino in the hotel room provides a master class in acting.
Just keep swimming ..
The cinematography was really nice and costumes designs were believable, as well as the fight scenes.
Not a bad trade off for a family night.
I'd love to have her over for a barbeque and just politic with her.
Lord knows I could really feel that.
We gave it as a gift to a 3 year old, he apparently already had one, but it's a great size to travel, and I'm sure he'll lose one eventually!
I regret having waited this long to watch this one, if you are in the same boat I was, stop dilly-dallying and watch it now.
Just bear that in mind.
he may not be the best character in the toy stories series but he is funny his face has a mean look on it which fits his character perfectly.
This is a fun family movie - highly recommend for a child old enough to comprehend the story.  
Like "Mary Poppins," regular home video reissues keep the films fresh and in the public eye.
If time was an issue, add another short.
Output is terrific too, with powerful low-end pulses, truly intense chase sequences and deep, resonant booms.
My issue with this movie orbits around one insignificant detail--because it irks me, it vexes me...thus I must discuss it, as it has bothered me for years.
This is a good, kid-friendly film and I say buy it!
I never cared about the plight of our automobile friends in the same way as I did for the toys, the fish and the superhero family.
WHEN I LOOK FOR ITEMS.
"The other point at which the animation shows obvious gloom is in the Pleasure Island sequence.
I had never seen this...after all, I scare easily, and could a monster movie really be cute, I wondered?
My little girl loved this.  
Also, the accessories will fit anyone (even Mommy!)
There are plenty of little jokes on that vein that both the kids and parents can laugh over.
This movie was great in Blu-ray.  
I saw so much more detail than I ever did before.  
and we watched it over and over again
Music Video -  "Never Land" - (3:16) Performed by Paige O'HaraMusic Video -  
Living an easy life.
Good picture and sound.
Honestly, I'm not one to like many movies, and animated movies even less.  
Our children are ages 8 (boy), 6 (girl), 5 (boy), 3 (boy), 1 (boy) and infant (girl).
This is a wonderful old Disney.
My four year old granddaughter really likes this movie, and it is one I will watch with her.  
The set is just ok.
My child enjoys this little wallet, its is perfect for him to hold his "money" and "credit cards" just like mommy and daddy.
She agrees but they're nearly killed in a crossfire and the date's off.
I just felt more attached to animal- ish Disney films, such as "Lady and the Tramp" and "The Great Mouse Detective", where there were no "stereotypic themes".
This is nicely large and soft so she can sleep with it.
In all, it had been nearly a decade since my last visit to Monsters Inc. and as a result of a recent mission to visit/ review as many computer generated features as possible, purchased the 2-disc DVD set being reviewed here.
We dress the kids warm on the cold nights (Central TX) and this bedding keeps them nice and cozy.
I love the interaction of the characters.
Almost no flaws in the 3D made it pleasant to watch, BUT...THE BIG BUT:  Simplistic shading of most objects and characters, create an effect, where even though the scenes have a 3D layering, individual objects usually look like flat cardboard cutouts standing at different depths.
It is a little thin overall.  
I don't recall anything in the text that led me to believe they were diecast.  
Thank you for reading.
no matter which way you make the waffle, it's a pancake.
This film essentially marked the very beginning of the studio's corruption into a corrosive mixture of sentimentality, a comedic meanstreak, sheer cynicism and heavy-handed propaganda all rolled into one.
We were lucky it played well.
Disc 3 starts with "The Luck Stops Here" which has an inventor with bad luck and needs Gadget's luck for fixing his stuff, next is "Fake Me to Your Leader" has Professor Nimul with a giantic ray that accidently zaps Zipper to become bigger as he has an army of bugs to plan a fake invasion of aliens in the city to steal gold.
In short they enjoyed a delightful mix of totally improbable hijinx and actual adventure.
This movie has a great script and a fantastic cast:  Sam Waterson and Mia Farrow among others.  
Turner's quest to release his father from Davy Jones servitude and the tragic backstory of Jones himself brought a new level of seriousness to the story.
Our children liked this movie & very cute one too!.
Many years later I found out how the animators (Disney's legendary "nine old men") did it: They made a live-action film first, to use as a reference.
Such a great price too.
We've had it now for 4 months and everything still works great and looks new (I also have a 1.5 year old son who plays with it).
This item was received well in advance of the projected delivery date, which was great.  
Terk and Tantor are okay for comic relief, but they're no Timon and Pumbaa.
I remember doing to a reshowing of this movie in the 1980's.
My daughter fell in love with Sully (Kitty) when she saw the movie.  
I put myself on their place and with a very big pride(I'm not from rich family myself, therefore I know my limits)
I had no problems with the product, everything was there and intact and it turns out this comes with a digital copy for iTunes or Windows Media Player.
My daughter discovered that the pieces don't float in the toilet, though.
I was happy to watch Peter Pan again as an adult.
You will recommend this to your friends.
This is THE first animated feature to be nominated for Best Picture and it deserves the countless glowing reviews professional Blu-ray sites have given it.  
At first I was thinking that the construction was a little sub-par for something Disney, but after thinking about it felt the game was rather ingenious.
The puppet comes alive, but is still made of wood, and will only achieve status as a "real boy" (i.e. a human boy with real flesh and bones) if the puppet earns that by doing good things, and listening to his conscience.
It's ok.  
Belle strongly disagrees.
I'd buy individual costumes sooner than this next time.
Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios.
When this arrived, I was pleasantly surprised at how soft everything is.  
Very  cheap made, and hair dryer doesn't even make sound like most toy dryers do.
It is not even close and has all the traits of a cheap, noisy, irritating and poor excuse for a cartoon.
Everyone should see this movie!
In his indigenous tribe in Alaska, Kenai is about to take his coming-of-age ceremony, which involves the very important part of receiving a token for his spirit animal (dictated to the tribe by their wisewoman).
Once Upon A Winter Time3)
And I was speechless, it was amazing to watch.
I loved this movie.
This movie is funny and shows the boys learning to appreciate more about the opposite sex but they don't look like believable girls.
NOT A GOOD PRODUCT.
This is where Donald leaves for the navy, and Scrooge meets the 3 nephews.
It would be nice if it also had Bones and the other pirate.
With a plot as obvious as this, so linear and expected in every way--maybe the movie's heart never connected with me because their was no "real" drama or surprise.
Purchased as a gift for my grandaughter.
Also, the cards that you use and the connection to the Disney Princesses make this a game that I know my family simply loved!
Great quality DVD, and seriously, who doesn't love this movie?
I won't even begin to talk about the plot, because it's a "tale old as time"
so that I do not have to wait an entire week for the next show.
The wolves are implied when Bambi's mother warns him of danger on the meadow.
Honestly, what's not to like or love about this movie.
Sleeping Beauty had 7.1 surround sound and was widescreen, this is not, even though it is a latter release.  
It did look great with the costume, though!!!
Had a preacher and a mermaid in the movie - not sure what the purpose of this relationship was - perhaps to spark more interest in it, but seems like an unnecessary tangent.
As with the other 3d Disney DVDs that we've obtained... this one is flawless.  
It is a timeless story.
I love Winnie the Pooh and how my 3 year old boys love and know all the characters but Rabbit's character not only makes you dislike him but fear him.
As many have said, the colors are beautiful; there is depth to the multi-layered scenery; the sound is great.  
A good episode, even if the moral is a bit heavy-handed.  B37.  
One thing I've always disliked about the Disney adaptation is that it took things from both Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, and mashed them together in such a way that my generation grew up not even realizing we were talking about two different books.
(Note: you must call a 1-877 to play this game).*
Cars is an excellent film and visually it certainly shows the growth of the studio's animation.
There is a lot of fun to be had with Buzz.
When I watched the movie, words couldn't express how brilliant it was.
Again, I'm borrowing synopsizes for the episodes from somebody else (E. Burgess, this time.  
Even my 5 year old daughter understood the message at the end.  
It's a sweet story beautifully portrayed.
Now we cut to almost 8 years since the movie came out and my completionist inner self came out
I've read many of the reviews before deciding to take a chance on this purchase.
At the one in this movie, Captain Barbossa recommends they release her.
but can they save the race of Earthlings from destruction?
It fits in the corner of our bathroom and has the sliding doors.  
Great movie with lots of action and colors.
Stupendous condition for the price.  
old Grandson and I were playing the games and all of a sudden we had answers from everyone in the house.
This is one of his best, although I really like "What About Bob" too.  
Jane chases the little monkey but finds a group of baboons that chases her.
You'll also hear from flowers and a door knob.
This was an animated series that I was obsessed with in my teens.
Bambi is one hour and ten minutes and was released in theaters on August 13, 1948.
She is quite nostalgic and it reminds her of her childhood.  
This is probably the weakest entry in the Disney canon that was released during Walt's lifetime.
I purchased these pins for a niece and nephew who were going to DisneyWorld.  
Pick this up and watch it with your kids!
Nice also to have the regular copy to play in the mini van on long trips.  
What starts out to be a local fund raiser soon is out of control and not just the talk of the town but, the world when word gets out.
The age range was listed as 2 and up.
The problem all starts when a little girl happens to tag along and follow Sulley back home...and, horror of horrors, everyone there believes that children are toxic to monsters.  
I keep hoping they'll re-release it in anamorphic (unlikely) or Blu-ray (probably out of the question).The movie itself is excellent, albeit quite long.  
Then after 5 parts we get "Back to the Klondike" is a story about Scrooge Mcduck who goes back to Alaska to find a long lost love and of course trying to find out who actually robbed him earlier when was once a prospector.
I will never buy any more of these lousy stinking rotten disks and neither should you.
Great movie, arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  
It is a nice size too, and would make an excellent under the tree gift during Christmas time...or anytime really!
At first I had hopes of enjoying a good comedy but sticking with it wore me out with the over the top silliness.  
'The Right Duck' is a DT version of Flash Gordon where Launchpad McQuack has a moment in the spotlight.
You would think with John Goodman and Billy Crystal at the comedy helm, this movie would have delivered much more fun and craziness and also be much more 'colored' in it's humor.
They watched it together and absolutely loved it.
I was just sitting and smiling.  
The Lion King - James Earl Jones5.
This is the 48th Tarzan movie and the only one word Tarzan movie.
This DVD will not be released until Tuesday -
Dinosaur Ducks:  Scrooge and Launchpad explore a land where dinosaurs still live, but the kids tag along against Scrooge's directions to the contrary.  C14.  
Sally's and McQueen's ride together on the country road.
My daughter, who is five, picked this out to buy with her birthday money and it was the cheapest here on Amazon.  
There's enough physical comedy to keep the kiddies happy, while the movie's main plot and emotional subtexts go way over their heads and keep the adults interested.
I like how the Diamond Edition includes a "Crab-E-Oke" sing along when ever the movie is paused for the inevitable potty breaks.  
THE INSIDER TRUE STORY ABOUT CBS 60 MINUTES WHEN THEY CAME UP AGAINST THE TOBACO INDUSTRY.
My scores for both Blu-ray discs rounds up to a nice, well-deserved 10.3D Blu-ray Audio Quality – The 7.1 Dolby TrueHD surrounded track is again totally awesome.
Then after Geppetto creates a puppet, he wishes for the puppet to become real.
I bought every single Doc Mcstuffins for Christmas and the kids loved all of them, but 4 days later, and I'm finding these small pieces in the dogs mouths, on the floor.  
Most of the extras are on a separate "Bonus Material" Blu-ray disc, which is available to rent.
I could never  tell from either Amazon or the back of the box description which episodes might be on first two volumes.  
Who could not love a tale as old as time with Angela Lansbury singing all the pertinent plot points.  
Well, the local's that we allowed to run a small shop on the base, would sell boot-legged DVD's with 2-3 movies on them.
I would not recommend buying this movie from here.
Loved it but am waiting for a refund for the double I accidently ordered and returned long long ago.
I was very turned off early on by the fact that I didn't really like any of the characters.
i really like this movie, specially on blu-ray, the picture quality will blow you mindits really sharp, crisp, amazing colors and contrast, its a movie for the whole to enjoyi bought this off amazon warehouse deals, it said "like new" and it came brand new sealedwhich
i did not get what i bought it said two disc i only got one an had no cover to it
I bought this for my son for Christmas and it was such a terrible disappointment.  
I just wish the quality of the material was a little bit thicker, especially for the price I paid.
The chest is made of sturdy cardboard and clear plastic on top, but would be easily squished if 6'4" Daddy stepped on it.
[Jeff York was featured in other Fess Parker films, but he's best remembered for his Mike Fink character].  
Had me smiling all the way though .....
He talks so seriously and it's funny that someone of that age thinks the way he does.
My son loves this movie.
4 Stars = ClassicI grew up with my mother raising Dachshunds.
I liked it..........
The car is very detailed and well made.
Red the firetruck is #3 in the Cars 2 "Deluxe" line of singles - our grandson fell madly in love with both Disney/Pixar "Cars" movies shortly before his 4th birthday, and he's particularly fond of all of the characters from Radiator Springs, including the very shy and emotional Red!  
I got it.
The cake was a hit.  
My kids Kindergarten down have really enjoyed watching this series (just as we did when we were little).  
They have to come out as soon as the program comes on the TV.  
What's not to love about this story.  
All the other characters are great, except for Flounder.  
If your girl is obsessed with Sofia then it's the best gift for her.
Get out the popcorn and soda and plan on a evening of laughs, tenderness, and even a little tear jerking.  
in all it's a nice package.
Disney Blue Ray movies are usually the very best in presentaion.  
This definitely increases their menace and contributes to the effectiveness of the story.
looks just as good as the day we bought it!
It's clean, crisp, sharp and over all a great film for everyone and this was the Disney film that got everyone back into animation...
I know it's not a big deal but this Mickey looks very cheap and not like the Minnie I ordered straight from Disney store.
This featurette alone is worth the price of the disc.  
Together they look like they walked out of the movie.  
I'm one of the late customers to get a 3D television.
Each Palace Pet comes with her tiara and a brush for her tail.  
Michael Mann shows that's he's the master of this long-form procedural type of movie.
In such a short amount of time it has to try to show an audience who may not know much of what happened, an overview of many months.
Received the DVD and showed the movie to family.  
My daughter enjoyed it
Did they succeed with Chicken Little?
I'm not a huge fan of Pixar but you have to hand it to them - they created a formula for minting money and they have stuck to it.
They're fun but they're also educational.
Rushmore is one of my all time favorites.
Indeed, this film and the lecture stand at the opposite end of the spectrum to the recently released and hugely over-rated Frozen, which, no matter how beautifully made and wonderful visually, is structurally flawed, dated, sexist and unpleasant in its core.
Simply endearing to the hearts of those who would watch it.
Rounding up Disc one is an alternate opening and a deleted scene (which are a little long but great to see).If you are still thirsty for more (and you should be), in Disc Two you'll find the inmmersive documentary Beyond Beauty.
Keith David as Goliath is just pure awesomeness.
Obviously, Walt Disney was not the one doing the actual animating for his classic films.  
One would think that being a baby product would make them consider the safety.if I was you, I would buy the munchkin one.
Worth the money!
This has always been one of my favorite Pixar movies ever.
it was a mickey shaped pancake.
My only complaint is that the pillowcase is very thin and I feel it will wear quickly.
The high episode of Disc 2 is "Much Ado About Scrooge."
The cast of characters is excellent and Mater's comments are funny.
I was devoted to watching The Muppet Show when it originally ran (I think it was on Monday night at 7:30, in syndication.)
Paint on the items isn't perfect, missing in some parts etc.
For the price, it's hard to complain about this product
We did find two small "cons" per say, the lid kind of bends in and snaps into place and while it's not difficult for us to open our little girl (who will be three in March) does have some difficulty with it and we have to leave it open for her
No more scratched DVD or Blu Rays!
Alice and the Doorknob - (1:32) Kathryn Beaumont, the voice of Alice, provides an introduction to this newly discovered live action reference footage of her playing Alice talking to the doorknob.
She likes to point to princesses and I tell her stories about them as we bathe.  
it gets most events, if not all of the characters and motivations, right.the second film, DAVY CROCKETT & THE RIVER PIRATES, is somewhat uneven because it consists of two stories, both of which almost complete baloney.
and i will recommend it to anyone.
And because this classic is known for its colors, its animation and presentation, the picture quality of "Alice in Wonderland" is magnificent.
He partners with a national breakfast cereal company to stage a weightlifting contest between Medfield College and the team of State College, backed by a rival breakfast cereal corporation.  
However, if you are buying this film for the first time or have a VHS version the Blu - Ray will give you a significantly improved experience compared to the earlier DVD releases.
The pillow is small and flat.
It's basically a parody mix with action scenes and a outlandish plot.
Just like the one on the movie!
(I guess that's why they have different princesses now-a-days).
Our daughter, who is now 26, watched Talespin when she was younger.
Thanks for your help.
This a gift for my Grandson.
I've seen it a good ten times in the last 13 years, and it is a rewarding view each time.
It is a good size, being almost 3 inches long and wider than the typical hot wheels cars.  
But once you work it all the way up the arm, you will find that you can't get the Velcro shut in the back.  
It's VERY accessible to just everybody out there.
Everyone in my household loves it!
Very cute stuffed animal.
The movie arrived in great condition and perfect packaging.  
Enjoy this great throwback.
Picking up shortly after the events of the first film, "Eloise at the Plaza", this film begins with the arrival of Christmastime, and the arrival of Mr. Peabody's daughter.
bought as a gift, and she loves it!
Captain Hook wants revenge at Peter for cutting off his left hand and feeding it to the crocodile.
Memories are funny things, because this was so politically incorrect and historicallynot true and chauvinistic to the max that I almost couldn't watch.
You still love him, as he bumbles through clumsy efforts to win the kindergarten teacher's heart.
Amber, like Sofia, does not have a base, and stands firmly in place without wobbling.
It came on time, but George of the Jungle was the one I really wanted.
The handle stays totally cool for easy operating, cooked cakes are easy to remove, and it's easy to fill the cavity to make neat faces.
Clear crisp pictures.
I think the plot of this movie really relates to everyone.
My baby wakes up throughout the night and would be nice to have a sound machine that stays on all night long rather than having to go in the room, turn it back on, and then shut off again in 45 minutes.
The graphics are a little strange, i double checked the packaging that it was licensed from Disney, but it is cute.
The mermaid bra doesn't fit well and leaves little Ariel looking exposed.
It never gets old and the kids can't wait to watch it over and over again.
Very easy to use with a push button that shuts off when released so it saves on the battery.
Still, it is visually amazing (honestly, so infectiously detailed) and the music (that song!) is so inspired and impactful.  
I have seen this movie several times and my family and I adore it very much!  
However, unless you get the Blu-ray Diamond Edition, you're missing a lot of wonderful, colorful "Mary Blairyness," in addition to other magnificent sights in the crisp, vivid Blu-ray picture.
In this case, the story is ever so familiar, but I seemed to have gotten the sequence wrong.
Our grandson has other cars but we think he is going to get a kick out of this one.
At first Patch and Thunderbolt did not get along but soon they became great friends, and when Cruella De Vil returns from prison to get her revenge on the puppies, it is up to Patch and Thunderbolt to save the day.
Isao Takahata has not only been responsible for the animated features Grave of the Fireflies, Pompoko, and Only Yesterday, but he has also been the producer on some of Hayao Miyazaki's film projects such as Kiki's Delivery Service, My neighbor Tototro, and Spirited Away.
5 year old daughter plays with this more then the Elsa/Anna dolls.  
How can you not love finding nemo?
This is a good family Christmas movie.
Oh well.  Call this high budget, high quality cheese with and zippy lack of depth and substance.  
I love this movie..
A coupe of them barely stand on their own and all of them are cheaply made.
George of the Jungle 22.
Not something I normally do with products.
Its like play dress up or having a tea party.
Pinocchio is funny but presents lessons about telling the truth at all costs.
This is not full screen, they kept the regular 4:3 format; which I like.
To all who collect movies like this then you will be pleased to know that it is coming out October 10th of this year,So now it is on Blue ray and that is cool.
The screenplay is so clever that you really have to listen closely to get the full effect.  
The voice acting is pleasantly plucky.
I liked the story line, I liked the animation, I liked the "characters".
it's so cute and cool -- with no detail missed-- even "ANDY" from Toy Story is inscribed on Buzz's foot like in the movie ....
It's very cheap plastic
I've had it a couple of months now and no rips or tear and it is holding its shape.
Gave this as a birthday gift for a 6 year old and she loves it.  
Along with The Life Aquatic and The Royal Tenenbaums, this one is one of my favorite Wes Anderson film.
Although that's pretty cute and heartwarming, and proves how much they love their uncle, I can't call a toy functional if it needs a wheel chair in order to do the only thing it is good for.
I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him.
The story never gets old; still very bittersweet.
The Mad Hatter and March Hare are hilarious!
Watched it today and its a fairly decent film.
and we bought these for her.
It's made out of flimsy cardboard.  
Other than that, the tub itself was pretty awesome and we used it for awhile.  
So, the question becomes "Is it worth paying $15 plus to see a film in theaters that is already available on DVD?"
It turned out to be a Region 2 DVD and would not play on my Blu-ray Player.
Get in for a good vibe and some conflicting situations because this one got a little bit of everything, shame it didn't last long on air though
this movie was like brand new never would have guess it was used grand children love them have watch 9 times already
The racing action certainly gets its due to be sure and kids have proven that a ragtag group of vehicles with eyes behind their windshields works just fine as toys, school folders, and backpacks.  
Two Native Americans provide company to Smith, and the three engage in low level philosophizing for a significant part of the time spent in this motion picture.  
This of course makes it easier for the "monsters" to do their jobs.
My son just loves playing with the car.
What I will be discussing is the 3D conversion.
Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted ChristmasIV. Lilo & StitchV. Sleeping BeautyBonus FeaturesI. Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted ChristmasII.
I did everything except worship it.
This is supposed to be a "sing-a-long" but there is no one to sing with.  
Meanwhile, Doofus and the nephews learn that a businessman is exploiting the reenactments for financial gain.  
It is smaller than expected, and the material feels cheap, not soft.
Watch it with your kids, they will love it!
Fighting hundreds of savage men dressed like bears who wear bear heads and furs, use bear claws as weapons, and never leave one of their own on the battlefield, but always take the heads of those they kill, the 13 heroes must fight and sneak past them in order to find the source of their hatred for everyone else in the world!
Maybe because it was my first.  
Parental Discretion Retired:
On the old "Ebert and Roeper" TV show, I remember that critic Richard Roeper somewhat dismissed the film as something the kids would enjoy, but something where the adults would be glancing at their watches every few minutes.
The multiple Jacks reminded me of some of the Twilight Zone entries: particularly one where a protagonist gets to spend his life quietly in a library reading but is deprived of his glasses, and one where everyone is not "just like" the hero but is actually a duplicate of him.  
Fun... Funny...
A neat feature of these trucks is that the tires act as though they have suspension.
This is a great movie.
Let's face it
A really nice item.  
We got this for our daughter.  
TaleSpin is still good today.  
This party was super jumpin' and he had some dope pizza.
In fact, I no longer go to theaters at all.
The film looks and sounds better than ever on Blu Ray.
This arrived with scratches on the stickers.  
Definitely in the top 10 shows from the 90s.....Tim, Al Wilson & Jill......an almost perfect combo to provide tons of laughs for the whole family......worth every penny to own this awesome show!
A sweet and hilarious story, gorgeously rendered monsters and an adorably precocious little girl all make this a must-own for any Disney/Pixar fan.
Any attempt to put on dresses of other dolls that come with any type of sleeve is a nightmare because of the joints and themobility of the wrists.
This was a Good clean movie.
In fact I watched the movie on TV several years ago.  
One of Disney's best animated features!  
I bought this movie to add to my collection, love the music by Phil Collins one of our favorites, a must see for all kids and add to your library.
I have to say though, that the prices I've seen here on Amazon for some of the PPs are quite exorbitant--some as high as $16.00!
Defiantly worth the time.
I first saw this movie with my kids and I think I loved it more than they did!  
I bought this movie for the kids I babysit for and it keeps them entertained during the week.  
I haven't given up hope!
My grandchildren are too young to know about the French and Indian War or the Revolutionary War but they totally enjoy the stories and the settings and they ask lots of questions which shows me that they're really captivated by the stories that for me as a child were simply good adventure stories.  
We will continue to purchase different dolls and keep our fingers crossed that the overseas manufacturing shop actually uses their quality control a little better next time.
The two disc Limited Edition set is beautifully encased and the second disc includes bloopers and deleted scenes.
Wendy, his love and Captain Hook, a classic villain.  
I'm enjoying switching to blu ray....
I liked some of the other 12 (the Viking) actors.  
We are trying to upgrade our entire Disney library on tape to DVD, the DVDs being so much sharper.
Great movie for all little girls - and my stepson at age 6 even got some enjoyment out of her meddlesome frolicking.  
Walt Disney had Alice in Wonderland in his sights for years before this film was made.
All the discs worked.
It reminds me what you would get from a claw machine.  
My toddler absolutely loved it.
Definitely a good investment.
It was a good deal to get both movies no complaints.
Growing up Bambi was never one of my favorite films.
This is one of those films that has moment to moment action consisting of grisly fight scenes of epic proportions.  
YOU GUYS ROCK!
If you pour a little too much it makes thicker cakes, a lot too much spills into surrounding areas, but it seems to resist spilling over.
There is a flashlight on there that needs a very odd size.
Great sci fi.
BUT, her Mom and I put together a tiara for her and she walked proudly around the house as a princess.
You then put your jewels onto your tiara, bracelet, or ring.  
But it's missing the heart and genuineness of Pixar's earlier works.
A wonderful, story about how action can affect change.  
They add a lot of depth and color to the room.  
He absolutely LOVES the costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it.
It does nothing worthy of complaint, make no mistake, but in my opinion nor does it excel in the arena of humor, plotting or sheer Pixar-esque cleverness.
Visually, it represents /the/ artistic high point of Disney animation.
i like the funny jungle book characters.
Took it off again today, found that the rubber band that connects to the motor is what's causing it to stop spinning.
It's got humor and drama and is filled with tension.  
LESTER LOVES MICKEY MOUSE AND HIS FRIENDS.
Who couldn't love Boo!  
What a beautiful and skillful adaptation.
I really liked this movie, it was a lot better than the 4th one, but the first two were better.
Total crap and to think another is coming forth soon.
However, the robot decides it would rather work for itself.  
My 4 year old son really loves Cars and Cars 2
The weekly show you loved on TV is now available for your enjoyment, and your kids and grandkids too!
I saw this movie when I was very young, and just like nearly any little girl, I was enthralled with it.
I could recommend this movie for children who are accustom to mild movie violence.  
The animation isn't too bad, though it doesn't hold up as well as my memory had it.
Joe Flynn has another extended scene of comic brilliance when he personally demonstrates the strength formula to a stuffy and skeptical corporate board.  
Bought this one b/c his other one got used so much it broke.
This featurettete goes into the art and Disney hiring its first female animator, the hiring of Tyrus Wong, who brought the look and feel of Bambi's artistic backgrounds because he wanted to move up in his job from in-between animation, the music of "Bambi", the history of "Bambi" and how the book was adapted into an animated film and more.
There is no volume control but a play, off and demo/try me mode.
Bought it for my dad who misses seeing the Disney shorts he grew up with.
I now have the DVD.
The bonus material on this collection is a wonderful bonus.
It's really basic, doesn't really do anything special, and just drags on and on for 45 minutes.
I would have liked to see Mike Wallace to play himself.
Elizabeth, of course, is just as annoying as ever.
The story is simple, the characters (Tinker Bell is a standout!)and songs are memorable.
Knocked unsconscious by a smack of the tail of this predatory home invader, Marlin awakes to find the enclave empty and his beloved mate no where to be found.
You won't recognize Russell Crowe as Dr. Jeffery Wigand, he was nominated for a best actor oscar.
Works well with Apple TV.
But enough DT bashing, I basically just explained how the Rangers came to be my new favorite.  
That made me happy because it means they enjoyed it
I do love the animation and art style though but the characters within it are the most annoying, irritating and obnoxious SOBs ever imagined.
After all, it managed to last to this point.
My daughter saw this show from Netflix a couple of years ago & has been asking to watch it ever since.
I love listening to the songs in this movie even without 7.1 speakers to take full advantage of what it offers (my software player uses dolby headphones to re-encode the 7.1 track to sound better for headphones).
They don't get cheaper with age!
They would tear off.
Saw the movie and then read the book back in college.  
It's cute, good quality
They took out some flaws, so if your one of those that hate when they take out things(even if it's for the better) you'll be quick to forgive it.
These are great to sit on the shelf but not great to play with at age four and six.
The quality of play is very different between the dolls, the way they act in your hand is different, the feel is different and the packaging is different.
Highly Recommended!Andrew C. Miller – Your Ultimate No.1 Film FanLe Cinema ParadisoWARE, United Kingdom
It is a great movie that my girls love to watch.
I also like that scaring is more of a business and it has this corporate aspect.  
I bought it as a Christmas gift for my little brother last year and it was broke before he even got to play with it.
The love between the mother and child is shattered by gunfire and the father comes in supporting the child.
Cars is an excellent film.
She was so excited!
I thought the kids would get a kick out of this but they seemed uninterested.
This DVD contains a documentary featuring two of 'The 9 Old Men" who brought so much magic to Disney and were the talent behind the genius Walt Disney.
With a house full of show quality daschunds, poor Dean Jones is always left with the short end of the stick (or so he thinks).  
However, the best part of the Blu-ray is the documentary, "Growing Up with Nine Old Men."  
At this point we all know the "Monsters, Inc." story.  
SO I BROUGHT THIS ONE.
I was looking for one for her, but could not figure out weather to get Perry as a platypus or as Agent P. Then while talking to my mom on skype, and we were both looking at Amazon.com, she came across this one, and figuring that it Transformed, it might be just the perfect one for her.
The movie was excellent and I really enjoyed every mintue of watching it.
Compare toBeauty and the Beastfor quality female behavior.
As for the story...
I have some mixed feelings about the first song "Belle", at times I liked it because it told a story, and at other times I found it just odd.  
He tells me that Pinocchio reminds him of himself.  
We received this item earlier than estimated date.
I returned my item within a few days, so it was still brand new in its original packaging - and they screwed me.  Will not purchase from this seller again.  
and I watch it on occasion, followed by lots of conversations about how poorly Ariel handled certain situations.
She's 8.  
She cried huge tears due to home sick and flooded the whole room and her self.  
What is with the running gag on crabs in this movie?
He loves everything Cars so the bedding set was a no-brainer for us.
The shoe do have grip at the bottom, which is great because your child will not be slipping and sliding.
Great actresses in their prime.
It still has the same affect on me as an adult!
Kudos to the people who worked so hard on it.
Great colors, great sound, great graphics and awesome in every way.
My daughter barely played with Lambie for one day (we celebrated Christmas late due to travels) and Lambie's neck came apart at the seam.  
DuckTails is a great family show this is a great season so if you feel nostalgic when you hear the theme get this set.
I think the story doesn't have to apply to just someone who tries to look inside their heart rather than their ugly exterior, but it can also applies to falling for someone who has an ugly past or has a mean streak and you are trying to see past all those things.
We just bought this five days ago and my son loves it and sleeps with it every night.
It's easy enough for my daughter to grasp at her age.
oh yes, she still loved him TOO!
this story is to funny and truly a classic for all the family to wach Ariel the Mermaid in her adventure.
Many critics consider Pinocchio the best Disney cartoon feature ever.  
And not all princes appeared to be very "charming".
I'm also really happy about the triple combo pack.
Wayne races against time and a smarmy corporate and professional rival (John Shea) to restore his son to normal without hurting him and save Las Vegas from his innocent destruction.
6. Contrast.
I would have liked to see more of them in one form or another, these are great animated comic characters voiced by four of the best in the business.2013 Blu-ray Bonus Feature-
GREAT movie; I heard a rumor they are re-releasing it in 3D before it goes to Blu-ray so I'm gonna have to make sure I keep on the look out for that one.  
Unless customers want a Disney film that spirals into insanity, I suggest they skip this one.
I watched this film when I was a child
Martin gets a hilarious assist by a fish named Dory (Ellen Degeneres).This movie looks fantastic and I loved the main plot.
My son now recites the numbers to put himself to sleep at night and also continues to repeat them throught the day as well.
It is not worth it to pay close to $100 dollars for a stuffed toy.  
Thanks, Amazon, for allowing my child to be completely spoiled without having to pay full price.
But they are trying to make this part of the Princess Diaries series so I can't like them as much.
Try rolling him and he falls over.  
Disney studios consistently puts forth excellent HD transfers and Peter Pan sets the bar.
My son loves all the characters, including Pete and Clarabelle, which aren't always includedThey are a good size for a toddler.  
Season 2 features each of the two most popular, highly-regarded shows of the series by mainstream fans- the mid-season turning-point episode "Phase One," which was the post-Super Bowl episode and the season finale, "The Telling."
One by one each of their classic movies are either being re-released in 3D before hitting Blu-ray or just going straight there.
Really enjoyed the film!
His airplane is a rattle-trap affair, looking like it was scrounged from the scrap heap.  
I finally had to get rid of my child's plastic bath because he kept trying to climb out of it and it would tip and I was afraid he was going to smack his face on the side of the tub.  
I being 23 still enjoy watching it from time to time.
Every scene in this movie just fits perfectly together, including everyone's favorite scenes: the ice skating, the "bird", and of course, the death of Bambi's mother.
It is so cute and looks and sounds just like Stuffy on TV, but I am returning it.
The most famous Disney Song of all time.
On a side note, $48 to own... really?
They're SUPER durable, so we know they'll still be around for him to pass along to his own kids one day!  
If you are curious about the appeal of Wes Anderson, Rushmore isn't a bad starting point.
and you do not have a real fancy Blue Ray pLayers then forget about it, yes forget about it.
But when I sat down with my daughter and my wife to figure the game out, we actually had fun with it.
He will sit and coo at it.
I would not be surprised if Carroll had at some point and in some fashion become "experienced", in a Jimmy Hendrix sort of way.
I made the mistake of letting her take it home, never to be seen again.  
a couple months ago i purchased this movie and i would like to say i really,really,really,really enjoyed it.even
I grew up on fairy tales, and though they were written versions and not Disney productions, I loved them and still grew to be a very independent, strong woman.
It's nice in that it offers a nice assortment of Toy Story figures at an affordable price.
Yeah, it's alright for a G, but I think it would have worked better if it was more adult-oriented with a minimum of PG-13 rated stuff coming from the lips of two of the best improv-style comedians that we know.
This apparently means she loves him.
The toys have stood up to the not so delicate handling of a 2 year old and she has a blast giving Lambie, Stuffy, Chilly and Hallie
Although, this two disc set has its exceptions, like the movie, music video, etc., it's not that interesting at all.
Very nice indeed!'Finding Nemo', is Pixar's fifth film, builds its dramatic spine from a parent's greatest fear.
As with similar direct transfers from the Technicolor negative, there is a huge gain in sharpness, resolution, and shadow detail, along with a reduction in "smear" and "muddiness".
This edition, Masterpiece, is really coool too becasue it has so much bonus material.
My son enjoys all his pixar car toys.
Kid thinks its only for cakes since it has a stand/support . . . . . .
You get a vague idea of what is going on, but your mind is so smothered by Jack Sparrow's shenanigans that you don't even really end up paying attention to the rest.
Great Friday night movie.
MUCH better than Lost!
Minnie is so cute and soft to the touch.
Well worth buying this in Blu-Ray!
this movie is a classic and i loved it as a child as does my daughter now.  
"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" is a unique science fiction film that pokes fun at bureaucracy and Armageddon scenarios.  
Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the "funny + heart" formula.  
Ever since it's 2002 DVD debut, there has been quite a controversy over the restoration the film has gone through.
You can barely hear the doll even speak when you pull the string and the color of his skin is so yellow I wonder if it's even the real one or a cheap version being passed off as the real thing.
My son is 4 and absolutely loved this.  
So, for example "Bambi: Inside Walt's Story Meetings", this may seem like on feature but really, there are about ten special features in that one feature alone.  
They don't feel like action figures that kids would play with.  
I have a granddaughter 7 and grandson 4, and they love this movie.  
i bought this as a present for a 4 year old girl, and it is adorable, much prettier than i thought, great quality, beautiful hair, love the outfit, and the eyes are just too precious.
Packaging was well done.  
I suggest a minimum age of 5 y.o.
The family member who hates  this is giving the review.
Right up there with other amazing animated movies such as Snowwhite, Cinderella and Dumbo.
so i'm pretty much on the fence there.
It looks really good and breath-taking in HD!
Basic and straightforward as the plot is, I won't bother going into TOO much detail about it - maybe.  
That must have taken some doing.
Easily deciphering what has happened, the grieving and devastated Merlin will take consolation in finding at least one remaining, but gashed egg knocked to the ocean floor by their home.
I was disappointed to learn that not all the episodes were made available, but I greatly enjoyed the three episodes on the disc.
I love this classic movie.
It is well made and cute!
Like most Disney movies, the music in this one was exceptional.  
My 5 year old grandson liked it as there was a lot of adventure.  
Disney has a knack for bring classic tales into the here and now with a major enjoyment factor.
Plays with her older sisters
I feel as though the picture here is misleading.
just watch it.  
I wanted to like this film.  
The Pascal toy is a perfect size for a child to use as a visual.
Looks like it would make great waffles.
This movie, unlike most, can be watched over and over, without wanting to frisbee it out the window.
Perfect for the little girl who wants to help mommy!
Disney Studios 13th full length animated feature film is also their most bizarre offering.
A great adaption of the comic.  
Wayne's World 28.
I have watched the Blu-Ray version and while I agree that over-saturating the characters make them seem a little out-of-place in the inherently dark backgrounds, it still didn't ruin my experience of the film.
It has no scratches or marks on the disk, the paperwork usually inside the cover did not come with it.
MY GRANDSON (HA,HA)  WOULD RECOMMEND.
Good family shows with no foul words and great entertainment.
Pull the string and Woody talks...
so i do to!  
This is the first time we have seen on Blu-Ray so it makes the experience even more magical (if possible).  
Russell Crowe playing a role unlike any other for him...as near as I know.
It helps children not be afraid of monsters as much.
I usually find myself thinking about Anderson's work several days after I see the movie.
This movie is so cool.
My son loves his new Cars bedding set.
I watched this again recently
This movie is so funny and cute.
Suzanne is raising Dachshunds for show.
The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows,  I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action.
Well now that is harder to describe.
Watching this on bluray was like watching the movie for the first time.
small and metal.
Carfinder Game: It's dubbed as a very sophisticated BD game, but I call it incredibly tedious.
And it's not like it just wasn't my kind of entertainment, there was a fair amount of redundancy in the songs story elements.
The 2nd volume of Ducktales is possibly my favorite (the only other candidate is Volume 3; even if volume 4 was released it would probably be my least favorite).  
Season 2 adds some solid emotional drama to the mix, as a person from Sydney's past returns.
Dialogue is crystal clear and perfectly prioritized, without a single muffled line, drowned cry for help or waterlogged whisper.
I love this movie and finally bought it.
and I was very happy to find it.
This episode was just a poor attempt at the 2 shorts format (which Gummi Bears pretty much mastered).  
It's still heads above the majority of the usual animated films and deserves a spot in any animation collector's library.
It was fun watching him be an actor playing an actor, acting a role to save his life and others.  
It avoids most of the deadly rom-com clich, thanks to a solid script and some nice tunes by Melissa Etheridge.
I would recommend this seller to all the people I know.
Still, I told them to give it a go, as they might be pleasantly surprised.
Before we went to Hawaii I wanted a good book to bring along.
This guy fits his requests completely.
He even sent me an autopawed photograph.
I haven't watched this DVD because I intend to keep it wrapped up like new.  
I think we've ALL had enough(!) of political correctness these days.
Davy & Georgie find out who the pirates REALLY are and the ending is a lot happier than the previous picture.
Love this movie!
She made a snow-man in the yard as a likeness of Olaf.  
Just wish we had a Pete and Clarabelle!
[Amazon = Rent Only ||
But any whoser very cute movie
Another classic that spans generations.
Cars BD is amazing.
Imagine the reaction there would be today if a rich and powerful but already unpopular British or American company - an oil company or bank perhaps - were to land mercenaries on an island under their government's protection on the other side of the world from their legitimate sphere of operations - let's say the Falklands or Hawaii - arrested the Governor, suspended civil rights, and conducted mass executions.
It includes a version of the hard to find and expensive Rescue Mater, which if your kid has seen the Mater Tales cartoons, they will want BADLY.
I'm sure you're thinking "well it wasn't made for the 3D".  
In fact, ‘Pinocchio’, as an adult, is one of my favorite Disney films.  
This is no different from pretty much any doll or Barbie doll out there.
This is a fun movie and I enjoyed watching it before going back and reading the books.Recommended!CFH
Personally, I don't mind that at all, because I much prefer a cloth shower curtain.
I can also see the jewels being lost in our carpet quite easily!Using the large red heart jewel to reveal the princess answer on the back of the card is kind of fun and prevents kids from accidentally showing the answer to each other or seeing it when the cards get placed back in the box all mixed up.
I am happy I found this editon because now they have it only in blue ray and I do not have a player
I bought this for my niece.
well made, pretty and easy enough for my 4yr old to handle and put together on her own now after we did it several times.  
Video & Audio:Cars arrived on Blu-ray on 2007 in a single-disc package.
The Making of Peter PanII.
It is kind of a weird looking Buzz as you would expect from a stuffed animal.  
JUDGMENT CALL:"Bambi" is a classic that will continue to entertain generation after generation.
Finding Nemo is a great film, family oriented and funny.  
A witch called the Angle of Death who is an oracle is called forth and she uses bones to say that 13 men must go north and 12 Norsemen volunteer.  
By far the better of the 2 Magica episodes on this set.  
It is a fine film with suspense and shows the deliberations of Crowe blowing the whistle on "big tobacco" while Pacino fights with the "60 Minutes" producers about airing Crowe's findings.  
Hoping once kiddo's recent animal fear phase passes she will want to watch more of it.
What a truly great classic Disney movie.  
You probably want to check to description and see if this mat is long enough for your kid.  
Its fun, insightful, exciting, speaks equally well to kids, teens and adults and does so without the sugary wallowing that came to epitomize subsequent Disney animation.
Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death.
It melded mythology with the modern world and future tech.
Whoever fills up their jewelry first wins.
It fits better than I thought it would, and the plastic is thick and fairly stiff after you inflate it.
Police arrive and surround the bank which leaves little doubt as what happens next, a hostage is needed and of cause Nolte is the hostage much bigger than the robber and wanting nothing to do with it.
used to watch this religiously when he was a kid.
And seriously how can you not like the Goof?  
It was cute.
She picked out this new prince.
I would suggest these doll for anyone that likes dolls.........
My kid loves them and she plays with them every day.
If he wasn't already attached to his sully from monsers inc he would probably carry this everywhere he went.
It makes me sing every time it's on.
There's also extras included, but we haven't had time to watch them yet.
My family saw MU in the movie theaters
`Pinocchio' is a childhood favourite of many and one I particularly remember loving as child.
The game itself is pretty simplistic and I think designed so that there is virtually no challenge to it - just jewel winning.
I always loved this movie as a kid and I still love it now that I am older.
Robert Redford is probably a better director than actor, and that's saying  a lot.
I'll continue to use until she outgrows it..
Nothing horrible, but if you are guarding your child's eyes or ears you may not wish to watch.  
i was wondering why nemo wasn't out on blu ray!only disappointment is though, this doesn't contain partysaurus rex toy story toons!my son was looking forward to seeing it again....
i was ecstatic when it came out on bluray/collectors edition.
She is into Tink and this is colorful, sturdy, and soft enough to cuddle with.
This is just perfect for our 8 month young daughter.
My 2 1/2 year old son is going to be ecstatic to receive this stuffed Jake toy for Christmas this year!
but I think it's a good buy.
The first time I saw this was on a plane returning from Fiji and am embarrassed to say cried when the storm hit and laughed at other times.
and this is my biggest gripe, Mickey is not dressed like mickey!!
and I put it in among all the other Disney classic fills such as Snow White, Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice In Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.
What might be overlooked is the fact that Jodi Benson plays two roles: Ariel and her "evil twin," Vanessa), both so distinctly that it's easy to think of them as two different voice actors).
If this and the first moive were stand alone movies and had nothing to do with the Princess Diaries series, then I would have liked it.
I guess they couldn't toss out Koda since he's integral to the story but couldn't that have used another voice actor.
It may have been brick and mortar compared to today, but it was and always will be a classic.
Just when I think Season 1 was fantastic, Season 2 becomes my favorite.  
She sleeps with Clover most nights now and even lets her little sister play with Clover.  
I really do enjoy this movie so I bought it.
Highly recommend item and seller.
Purchased this as a christmas gift for my niece who is obsessed with anything Minnie Mouse so of course she loved it!  Seems to be fine quality for the price, comforter is nice and soft.  
The artwork changes and compliments the scenes of the film.
The males in the cast are presented as warm and loving men who, with one exception, adore and stand up for their wives, who come under a great deal of criticism.
I was skeptical a good sequel could follow Monsters Inc but this works great.
There are actually few extras that weren't seen in previous dvd releases, but this version trumps them all with its "Through the Keyhole" option.
It's just like the one in the movie!
That's all.
Animated cars racing around....?  
It's worth the repurchase in my opinion.
And we found it sad--just like real life.  
Love, Tom selleck in anything.
In the end, they discover that they should be thankful for the gifts that they do have.
Some people are really stuck on "classics" but looking at this rendition of the story by itself, it's actually quite good.  
That surviving egg happens to be Nemo.
the hat is great for spring or fall weather.
We will more than likely buy the two volume series collection for our daughter so that she can share Talespin with our future grandchildren.
This movie is a real enjoyable show with many laughs.  
Depp never dissapoints as savvy Cap'n Jack.
Yes, the plot and story was a bit hard to understand, but the action, romance and funny Jack Sparrow along with great music more than makes up for the plot.
There is a flange molded into the wrist, and a tiny ziptie tightens around the wrist and the flange keeps the hand on.  
My daughter grew up with her & I watching this movie and it is very funny and good family fun!
#4 The shoes did not or do not come off.  
When last we saw our characters (in the cliffhanger from the last film), Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been swallowed by a giant sea creature and presumed dead.
Everything was as described and I have enjoy it very much .
Look forward to future buys with you.
While this High Resolution audio is not losseless (as the Master Audio), is very effective and I don't think  Bambi could hear any better.
Johnny Depp was born to play Captain Jack Sparrow....it is a defing role for him and he nails it.....
His prospects improve.
If you like Disney Pixar movies, you will also love this movie.  
The movie cost $100 million dollars.  
Firstly, the sizing is way off.
and i also really loved the special efects and the animation in this movie.
so obviously I needed to get with the program and update.  
The only thing that surprised me was the odd rendition of the songs (not even CLOSE to the originals) and the woman who speaks before each song and sings the songs has an accent
I think it's a bit small, but she says it's the size most are.
This is a keeper.  
I love this movie.
The animation in this film is what we've come to expect from Disney and the story is intriguing, but I guess because I had never seen this film it didn't have the same effect as other Disney's films I grew up with.
While being entertaining, at least, it just shows pictures of the movie that "magically" turn into video clips.
But the Baby is too young to watch it at this time.
The beautiful backdrops of painted deserts and canyons.
Stromboli however, isn't the only great character in the film.
Due to World War II and other reasons Bambi lost money in the theaters and thus the next six films were the infamous package films.
Legion:  Coldstone is reactivated, but some sort of virus begins to affect him as Goliath tries to get him to join his clan, his mind had been merged with the personalities of two other Gargoyles and one of them holds a grudge seemingly bigger and more malicious than Demona's.  A17.  
His gift in music writing and orchestration delivers an atmostphere that brings the kid in a lot of us.
it stays on well and so far we have used it for a few months and its just like new.
I really enjoy this DVD and would recomend it it if anyone likes Disney Classics or Alice in Wonderland stories.
Phil Collins, who is one of the best musical partners to work in Disney films, according to what Disney music president Chris Montan told me (Collins would make himself constantly available even from his Switzerland home), again creates songs that have a viable pop sound but don't sound dated it all today.2004 2-Disc DVD & 2013 Blu-ray Bonus Features-
Language isn't a major problem, but many uses of "hell," "son of a ..." and several a** are thrown around.
And being 2 years old, mood swings are on the menu lol.
The second volume of my other favorite Disney Afternoon series.  
While in the camp another Viking boat appears and a boy asks for the help of the Viking warriors to return and help defend his father's northern kingdom from the Wendol.  
This movie is just not what I want influencing my kids or myself, Tinekerbell is a murderous wench, Peter Pan is a jerk and I found myself bored during most of this movie.
IT STILL WATCHES IT EVERYDAY!
this movie is really cute, and a must own for kids and teenagers.
This is a family oriented film.  
After Disney's stunning release of "Alice in Wonderland", I knew that Bambi would have the same care & quality put into it's remastering.
It's fun and funny and it's clean entertainment for the family.
The film was received in a timely manner and in excellentcondition.
I absolutely LOVE this movie and it's one of my all time favorite animated movies.  
The special features includes deleted scenes, bloopers and a behind the scenes look of the film, as well as trailers for other Disney DVD favorites.
Pinocchio's promises are always broken by the slightest temptation to slack off or have a good time, and this of course gets him into real trouble.
Your little boys will love it.
It does not quite fit on the race tracks but my kids still try to make him go down it.
The movie does a good job of capturing the time period.
Love Is A Many Splintered Thing - Monterey Jack's old flame Desiree returns, but is still using Monty and working for a bad weasel crime boss.  
This is a awesome movie.
Supposedly the Academy Awards are about the work.
We watched while I was vacationing @ her home one evening & enjoyed it a lot.
I love the exposure to all different kinds of animals and the idea of team work that it portrays.
Could not believe how quickly I received Monsters, Inc.
Great movie which I just bought for my three-year old.
it's not normally what I watch, although I do buy movies that are faith related, not this faith.
some of the tricks they did to sell the idea of the kid being larger than theparents were fun to see.
Bought this movie brand new.
The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars2) The Spirit of Mickey3)
This is a fun family movie andI would recommend it to anyone and it was just what I expected
The Pirates of the Caribbean movies are action, comedy and drama and juggling the three can be a challenge.
Each shoe has a different type of heel on it.
Nifty, huh?
The movie is fun to watch and I enjoy it as much as he does.
We had seen this film in the theater and decided to buy it.  
Kit and tools until she's older, but she loves doc and the talking animals!
These shoes look very cute but they have not come out of the package yet since they are a Christmas present for my grand daughters (I bought two sets).  
My granddaughter is so very happy with this.
Apparently you can also take the hand and leg out of the joint and snap It back inplace that you can not do it with this doll here!That is great because two of those dolls I had to remove was because the hip joint or thearm joint broke off.
A great movie to sit up and watch with the kids.
He also sleeps with it and watches cartoons with it.  
This amulet looks just like the one Sofia wears in the show, and it glows when you push the button in the back.
Will be enjoying this favorite old much-loved Disney classic with the grand children very soon.
A good episode, but it's nowhere near as good as Rescue Rangers' A Case of Stageblight.  B17.  
This is great material for my daughter in anticipation of the Muppet movie coming this Thanksgiving.
After the establishing shots, though, it does get somewhat better.
Alice Shrinks - (:54) Kathryn Beaumont introduces a newly discovered pencil test of Alice shrinking.
It is a thing of visual and poetic beauty that is also an uncontested masterpiece, and certainly one of the greatest films ever made.
The only real issue I had was one light in one of the wings burnt out in under a month.
The story is very cliché and not very interesting.  
I wish Disney would do more handdrwan films like this.
She still thinks Rapunzel is the bee's knees and the loveliest doll that ever was.
You can't use them in the tub because they are heavy, don't float and have those platforms stuck to their feet so they don't fit on the pirate ship.
I  was watching an episode where they had Burt and Ernie as a child you don't pick up on anything, but as I was watching it Burt and Ernie had the same or similar voices of the two people who did the voices of Kermitt and Fozzie  bear.  
It was just a fine movie ,from start to finish - mostly because the story is true.
My 4 year old gets so frustrated every time she tries to open it, she has to call me to do it.
Now thanks to DVD I can share that love and wonder with my Grandchildren.
Finally, the action scenes are overtly dumb and stupid.
My 4 yo daughter likes to make it light up at night and wave it around.
One of the most interesting among the many bonus features (this one from the earlier DVD release) is a storyboard of a deleted sequence in which Wendy and Peter are about to part and the dialogue gets so romantic it might have been a scene from An Affair to Remember.
The Edge:  Elisa has a new partner, Matt Bluestone, a conspiracy buff.
When I finally got around to putting in my newly acquired DVD of Disney's Last Flight of Noah's Ark though, I hadn't seen it since I was a child and really didn't have much of an idea what to expect.
So, I think when one rights a review and you have to mark the stars I think it should be how the recipient liked it.
The imagery created was roughly as depicted in the book.
I know it is for me.
It is also great to have around when our nephews come over.
This one never gets old.
My son loves Wreck-It Ralph and now he has one to cuddle up with at night!
On a 60" plasma display, this is both subtle and stunning.
This edition has great pict quality.
i resevied my package today davy crockett this is a very good walt disney movie i frist saw this movie when i was just a little kid i highly recomened this movie for every one you will enjoythis movie very much.
While the laughs aren't huge, they are there, and while you won't be laughing every time you watch it (assuming that you watch it more than once), the first time will deliver a slew of mildly entertaining takes on rather uninspired gags (yes, we've seen almost all of these gags before, done better I might add) and yet, there is something about `Sorority Boys' that makes it enjoyable.  
A very endearing movie which will touch your heart.  
it's a very good, true life story.if you ever feel down and need to be uplifted, watch it.
Overall, most people will really enjoy this movie.  
I remember watching these on TV many years ago and loved them both, I was not really happy after finding out that while enjoying the show as they go forward I was very disappointed when finding out that the last episodes of both series were not there.
For those who are interested, the real Calendar Girls began their fundraising in 1999, and the main characters Chris and Annie are based on Tricia Stewart and Angela Baker, who in turn were inspired by the death of Angela's husband John Richard Baker, to whom the film is dedicated to.
I got it for the two of us.  
I am glad we bought this.
I'll just mention one that speaks about teamwork,The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Unabridged on 5 CDs [5 Dysfunctions], a "leadership fable" that focuses on the characteristics directly opposed to the building blocks which the author claims are essential for teamwork to develop.
She was very excited to play this game when we first received it, but after playing a couple of times, she quickly lost interest.  
The sticker on the small perfume bottle came off in about 2 days, but that has been my only complaint.  
Pay more for a better made product.
I love watching this movie, no matter how old it is!  
(John Turturro plays toothy nebbish Stempel way over the top according to the real Herb.)
Amber is my least favorite figurine in this set.
It has a number of noteworthy performances, especially the central three, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Willliams.
They even loved Waldorf & Statler!This show reminded me how amazing Jim Hensen is & how he was ahead of his time.  
This movie is heartfelt, and very touching and wonderful for almost any age.  
Not everyone likes what's often been doneturning the story of Alice on earbut I say, it's in spirit of funthere's really nothing at all to fearso what if Walt Disney brought forth Tweedledum and Tweedl-deeand introduced Alice to the Walrus and his carpenter bud-eeand all those talking flowers!
Disney did a pretty good job with the story and keeping it decent for younger viewers.
The Pirates movies are just really well done.
So I found it on Amazon for $20 cheaper than the store.  
this is one of Disney's best films.
It came in great timing, durable packaging and the price was one to be beat!
I would recommend it for any little one 2 and up.
He has wings:)Cons- You have to tighten the screw on the back, so that his wings don't come off and the directions are not clear about that!-
However, the blanket is really great - not too heavy and not too thin.  
This is one of those movies I watch over and over again.  
Pleasantly surprised at how nice it looks on my 2 yr old grandson's toddler bed!  
My kids love this movie.
But with Alice, this wasn't the case.
To play, you draw a card and guess which princess is on it.
This is an Awesome Disney movie.
I love watching it now and feel the same love that I did for this movie when I was little.
All of the Walt Disney animal based shows of thistime period are good.
Would recommend this toy.
Great job by all the cast members.
I'm going to have to watch it another couple of times to see if I can figure it out.
I washed them and they were fine, but it was still a little odd to me.
This is pretty good entertainment.  
I am chemically sensitive so I did not like this.  
Will is also in for rough waters when he must discredit himself to avoid being killed by SD-6, since an editorial he wrote about the undercover agency was printed after his disappearance.
They also look great!!!
My children liked it and were entertained by it but there were a couple of parts in it they could have left out like the birds and the bees.
I'm not sure how on earth some of the previous reviewers said that the hand fell off the arm on their doll since the only joints on it are the tops of the arms and legs, but I'll be sure to update this if I find a wee little Rapnuzel arm hanging out of the toy box any time soon.
Most notably, the wings extend further and there are lights on the end of the wings.  
One of the Blu-ray deleted scenes is a song called "Twitterpated".
They are the right size to be held in hands and carried all over the place.  
An all time Disney Classic, it is just one of those all time must see movie, would highly recomend to any one who hasn't seen it or to anyone that has not seen it for a while
No hassles just bought and watched.  
Definitely a must see and worth the money.
Anyway...With over a thousand reviews already rockin' Amazon, I just wanted to throw in a word for the Blu-ray.  
For those used to the newest cartoons with CGI generated graphics, this one shows its age.
They watched the film on their PS3, through Instant Video, and had no issues.
For instance, Mr. The King is a reference to Richard Petty, and Pixar does just about everything but come out and call him Mr. Petty.  
I GOT THIS FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVE ANYTHING DOC MCSTUFFINS.  
Disc 2 has "Duckman of Aquatraz" where Scrooged is framed for a crime he didn't commit, "The Money Vanishes" has the Beagle Boys who steal a ray gun and special spray that can make things disappear and reappear in any location as they want Scrooge's money.
Doll is a good size for play or to display.  
It is not as fancy as another plush Rocket sold here on amazon
i wanted to show this to my 4 year-old-sonhe loved it!
I do not want to spoil the story, but will say it is well worth the purchase price.
it is not balanced so accuracy will be an issue and may cause frustration.  
A world that is, as Rod Serling put it, "beyond that which is known to man".
We had one before but after a year of being banged around they died, which is acceptable.
LOVE THIS FIRST ONE.
And this bad part is that, when you strip it down to the bare nuts and blots, the plot is really the anti-fairy tale.
For synopsizes of the episodes, I'm going to borrow Monty Moonlight's (with some editing here & there) & give my 2 cents on each one.  
You see the similarities between cultures because in the end, all families behave the same way.
The boys wanted every cars toy to play and line up.
Not one of Disney's best but enjoyable none the less.
they are not cheap ones they are fancy gorgeous figures.
The story tells of a baby deer named Bambi who loses his mother to a hunter and is brought up by his father, the Great Prince of the Forest.
Wonderful movie for the whole family!
It contains, in addition to the movie itself, all sorts of extras like little games to play and video about how the movie was made, including interviews with some of the stars and the creators.
The scene where the apes and the elephant, Tantor, discover the camp and trash it to music is FUNNY!
It's still one of my all time favorites!
There is character growth going on.
Having watched the film now a third time I have had a change of heart.
There are plenty of folks who enjoy squandering their life in watching animation games, but a movie must make a point.
Her outfit is stunning and eye catching, but there is one problem with it....the glitter!As soon as my daughter picks up the doll and plays with her, her hands and anything she touches are covered in glitter!
The original Alice in Wonderland books were brilliantly-disguised pieces of social and political sattire, with the behaviors of the various characters poking fun at a number of trends which existed at the time, and much the same thing can be found here.
My grandson absolutely loved it!  
The journey is long and dangerous but it is nothing when compared to the battle that will soon begin against a horrific enemy that none of them can imagine and no one has seen for over 100 years....
The most boring episode of the whole series.  
My oldest daughter turned three this past winter and for one of our movie nights I picked up Season One of DuckTales.
Package arrived on time and in great condition.
and it wasnt scratched and worked great
But he was hurt and pushed her away.
Not sure why, but this movie is so poorly written conceived and performed even my young children couldn't watch it.  
It took my birthday girl (turning six) about 20 minutes to construct.
I am now 24, and Beauty and the Beast has lost none of that zest.
Rented it first, and decided it was a keeper!
All pretty visuals in a film this nasty and this hateful can do is ultimately invite others to sit back and embrace the film for all it has to offer: Carefully calculated sentimentality, trite jokes, and unlikable characters.
Disney Studios 30th full length animated feature film.
Factory sealed upon arrival and still cheaper than at walmart.  
Some even get a fair bit of star power for the voice actors.
I wonder if she did her own stunts, maybe.
And let's not forget the CGI (computer generated imagery) effects like on the ships and storms.
I recommend getting the blu-ray packaging, because it is a little smaller.
Disc one includes The Disneyland Story which is the debut of the Disneyland series and the second feature Dateline Disney the televised opening day at Disneyland hosted by with Art Linkletter.
The blanket is not thin like I had read in some reviews.
Each time I watch it, I notice things I didn't notice before.
My only complaint is the cracks all over her that are supposed to look like the fine cracks in the glaze on china, aren't painted so they just look like weird ridges.
I will say that at times it did have some technological/feedback issues but it worked itself out..
It's a great movie for everyone in the family.
We had to bring Pooh with us everywhere.
I loved this movie when i was a child, and i am 26 now.  
The movie was nominated for one Oscar (best score) and contains a number of songs, as well as having a strong musical presence throughout.
Do I really need to say anything else?
The arm panels, however, remain attached.
Fun little car.
Enjoyed reviewing the story of David Crockett.
This movie is a great story for young children and the music is fantastic (Phil Collins).  
This sequel was just as funny as the first movie as the actors return to bring much laughter into the homes of many American viewers.
Shere Khan is head of almost every business in Cape Suzette and is coldy cunning.
I know that with the "Platinum Edition", there were some who felt the picture quality was changed slightly but from my own personal viewing, the film looked colorful, detail of the backgrounds and environments looked amazing and I saw no problems with artifacts or banding.  
It is very interesting how they were able to train the chip to do the various things it showed in the movie.  
They have enough of a heel that my daughter will feel like she is "fancy" but not so much that she will break her ankle!  
I miss it and was more than giddy to find it out on dvd.
She outgrew it long before the stated 24 months, but she is tall so that could be why.
Musically, "Alice" has more songs than most Disney films -- too bad most of them are mere snippets!
Characters go this way and then that way, on and off the phone, or in and out of cars.  
They know her to be a thoughtless and selfish fish-killer.
I regret wasting money on this, and hope I can return it, it is that bad.
Purchased as a gift for a family member rebuilding his Disney library after it went missing in a household move.  Received it on time and in great condition.  
My two year old loves it.
A shockingly violent & strong episode on how dangerous guns can be.  A+9.
Look I know this film has been released in so many different formats before it's hard to count
Chow's character could've been much better, but he just seems like a waste of space.  
Most of us like the idea of our cars having a personality and this really works with that.
The recipes that came with the instructions weren't very helpful, and it would be nice to be able to store it upright, but it still rates 5 stars.
As technically marvelous as something 1992's Aladdin is, one could easily tell that a good amount of the animation was done with a computer (I say you need look no further than a look at the Cave of Wonders).
I have to admit that I am prejudicial toward any film that Antonio Banderas stars in.  
The discs are hard to get out without scratching or dropping them unless you take out two at a time.
Because we're out and about a lot, it's nice to have a small potty seat to bring with us just in case.  
Cine-explore (shortened visual commentary)
Finding Nemo sucked the moment Nemo rebelled and never recovered.
Most films released during the time (1951) were filmed in black and white, as Technicolor was VERY expensive.
I hoped to fix it, but saw that it was only held in place by a small stick of plastic about 1/4 inch thick that had snapped.
The park didn't have it anywhere....too bad because it truly is a great hat.
For adults watching it alone, it won't appeal to everyone in the way that perhaps a Pixar movie would.
I an so glad I didn't spend a ton if money for a brand new copy.
And I got it on sale $9.99 who can beat that!?
I add my name to the list of those who find this wonderful story highly recommendable!
And it's been a keeper in our kid movie collection).According to my 3 y.o. niece while she was running around the house pretending to be a car: I watched Cars!
Lessons learned =)
When you put it in, there are no menus, it goes straight into the movie.
It is charming, especially in the story of the juvenile Tarzan.
Posability - Doll is amazingly posable, easy to set and holds the pose strongly firmly and gracefully, no problem with pose going undone or hands falling down or head going round and round or anything like that.
Universal Studios, Walt Disney Studios.
Here's a review of every episode with synopsizes from Wikipedia.1.  
Lots of funny parts and a few scary parts for kids.
Product seems fine for what it is.
There is no Play All feature.
One of my favorites was the short-lived Chin n' Dale's Rescue Rangers.
Anderson would go on to continue giving us quirky yet extremely heartwarming films while Schwartzman evolved into a very talented actor and worked with Anderson on several other occasions.
Pinocchio (1940 Disney) was a simpler movie, not set in a grand palace or peopled by elegant royalty or ending with a final reward for the main character of being taken by Prince Charming to a golden castle in the sky with celestial choirs grandly singing "Someday My Prince Will Come" punctuated by sonorous wedding bells.
This is definitely not my favorite Disney animated feature.
The special features includes the very first episodes of the Recess series(first aired on ABC-TV in 1997), and sneak peeks of other Disney favorites like Lizzy McGuire and Power Rangers.
If you have kids that love car movies then they should definitly buy this movie because I'm positive that once they see this movie, they'll want to watch it over and over again.
I'm sure they'll have fun.
Big Tobacco companies go as far to halt the original interview and prevent CBS from airing it, but what I loved about this film is how Lowell Bergman was able to orchestrate, out of desperation, to sacrifice his career in order to get this show broadcasted by using his journalists contacts for major newspapers to come to bat for him.  
It is dated and its historical origins seem to lend to only so much of more than minimal excitement.
I'm sort of thinking of putting the pieces in Ziploc baggies in then putting them in the box, that way we don't lose anything.  
I would consider the little dog a choking hazard too for the kids who still chew on things.
My little niece loves here Mickey shaped breakfast!
We love red he us a cute sensitive fire engine that waters flowers and cries when he is sad or his feelings are hurt.
I opted to go with the 50 dollar buzz at toys r us.
I was a teenager.
We have it for close to a year now and girls love it.
But mainly, I did not want to fill up the big tub every night.
There is a mini-menu at bottom that you can use to "Play" or "go to Menu" .
I rarely have an issue but they put this item, with a very flimsy plastic shell over it, in the same box with a 10+ pound batting tee.
This princess Merida doll is very beautiful.
Next to 'Elfego Baca' and 'Davy Crockett', this series is considerably slower and dryer, in spite of the presence of guns and the inherent drama of galloping horses.
Product arrived in great condition.
This is a great keyboard.  
It is NOT a sickeningly cloying, sweet movie.
Julie Andrews and Anne Hathaway are great in these roles.
Ultimately, Finding Nemo's 3D presentation is as spectacular as its 2D counterpart and will surely delight long-time fans and newcomers of all ages.
This is what animation was made for, and this is what I wish Disney and others in America would do again.  
never to old to watch this movie
The original team has come back to do another calendar, they say.
This story was interesting, fun, comical, stretched the boundaries of belief, but yet created a good balance of art imitating life.
My twin 2 year old girls loved them.
Kenai and his brothers pursue the bear, but a fight follows on a glacier, Sitka giving his life to save his brothers, although the bear survives.
A keeper for all ages.
I ordered a used copy and got it within a week.  
The images are beautiful.
The music is not only entertaining, but it informs people about the characters in the story.
I won't discuss them here, but I will say that you're really missing out if you've purchased this combo set and don't avail yourself of watching the extras.
It also has a velcro strap so you can attach to the crib away from baby
Even my older kids enjoy it.
Expensive for a DVD that gets scratched easily.
My son loves his Buzz doll and plays with him daily.
The colors seem to be as on-target and faithful as those in the Sleeping Beauty bluray.
This is one movie you want to own,  I recommend you buy it!
It is so dear, funny and beautiful.
The digitally restored, high-def transfer is breathtaking in scope in that it seems not one frame was left un(re)touched and cleaned.
I am truly disgusted by my fellow Americans that are literally buying the stores out of all Frozen related products ( while the rest of us are at work)  and then holding them for a hefty ransom.
I Love Classic Disney Movies...
They misread the note that Christopher left for Pooh, and determine that he has been kidnapped and taken away by the evil "Skullosaurus".
You may be surprised.
I would go to the online place where the big eared mouse himself sells his wares because this was half the amount they are asking here & not expensive to deliver.
My first grader is a great fan of Eloise, and we have read all the stories and watched the animated series.
She loved it too.  
I guess I was just thinking it would be like many of the other ghibli movies, but this one is a little boring.
Bambi is a wonderful must-own classic from Disney.
I have to admit, as much as I enjoyed it when I was younger, I enjoy it even more now since I read the original story.  
It's funny and entertaining worth a watch.
While waiting at the hospital, both Annie and her best friend Chris (Helen Mirren) become aware of how uncomfortable the furniture in the family waiting room is--a trivial point--but when John dies, and Annie wants to raise money for new furniture, Chris has a brainstorm: the women's club will produce a calendar showing various local ladies in semi-nude but tastefully concealed poses.  
Then he falls in love, and he has to defeat the other suitor.
Perhaps the Monstropolis dimension is on a different time line, where hours there are the equivalent of minutes in our dimension (time relativity and all).
Make believe is the work of childhood.  
My kids love to watch these movies on their ipads.  
i watched it when i was younger so its fun to watch with him and see how excited he gets
Why it took Pixar so long to put out this movie in Blu-Ray is beyond me.  
I was really surprised at how exciting this movie was.
What I mean is that the cars match the personalities they embody perfectly.
All about dreams and going for it all.
Peter Pan's Playful Prank StorybookVIII.
The bloopers at the end are funny too.
Suspend reality completely and don't expect too much.
There's enough in it that's factually correct to give an overview of what turned out to be rigging of show outcomes on a grand scale.
"Bambi: Diamond Edition" is another must-own Disney animated classic on Blu-ray and is highly recommended!
Enjoyed the story and action throughout.
I liked this film but it didn't resonate as well with me as his other films like Tales from Earthsea.
Of course, he does not stand up on his own, but Woody and Jessie can straddle him and look like they are riding him.  
I received at a reasonable time.
This DVD version has some additional songs and a short introduction for each song.  
As well as dissecting the scene and the characters of the film.  
Way better than the original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids , this movie is very funny,cute and exiting!
I generally end up taking them out when the game is finished because I don't want the jewelry to be bent or broken when removing them.
It's been a month since I got it and inflated the tub, and it's still going strong.
The typical adjectives used to describe Anderson films can be applied here: Witty, quirky, odd, sentimental, dry.
The cast is awesome and engaging.  
It does make me pause and wonder how the direction of network entertainment would have changed if our federal government had been able to regulate with a strangled grip on sponsorship, truth in advertising and over sights on producers and the networks they worked for.
Christopher Plummer is slightly less effective with a cartoonish take on the iconic newsman Mike WallaceProviding equal parts morality play and thriller, Director Michael Mann leaves an invisible footprint on the movie, allowing characterizations and plotting to step to the forefront while style, tone and visuals take a back seat.  
Such a cute movie and amazon makes it so easy to download or stream to the kindles.
The DVD was in perfect condition.
I really enjoyed them and was sorry it didn't last past a couple of seasons.
Which means a lot of the story elements have been dropped, reimagined, and just generally tampered with to produce an unfaithful adaptation which you may or may not like depending on how much you enjoyed the original book this animated feature claims to be based upon.
Well, the film is what it is.  
This is a great movie !
Super fast ship!
I do not know about you, but I can not stand watching most of the current cartoons or shows that my daughters enjoy.
There is not much romance to speak of (although Ahmed does have some sweet scenes with a Viking girl) but my curiosity toward their enemies and my hope that everyone would survive kept me watching.
These are the perfect size for little hands to hold.  
In an instant, the once free clown fish finds himself captive (with several other inhabitants) in the waiting room of an Australian dentist's office.  
It does what it promotes
Can't wait to have his cake so he can play with them.
What an influence from a Disney movie!I think the music in this movie is superior to some other Disney movies.
What a beautiful doll!
waste of $$
She sleeps with her.
I have only seen this movie in a theater, and I was quite pleased to find it on DVD.  
Perhaps most distinctively, Alice distinguishes herself from other cartoon heroines in that she seems to have a raging obsession with formality, dignity and politeness, which I still find one of the most charming traits any protagonist could possibly have.
Another Disney Classic - This movie has a great sense of humor that has both kids and parents laughing!
'Luck O Duck' is a nice Saint Patrick's Day special.
He really smells like strawberries.
They are good quality, simple, and easy for her to set up.
My daughter love her Lambie.  
The fact that the Revolutionary War is "a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year" is the very reason people need to watch "The Swamp Fox."
Bravo for the new version.  Love the songs and the beauty of "under the sea".
A journey very similar to the human experience.
I watched it four times since I got it
It's MY quirk, not my daughters, and she's more than happy with him, so he gets nothing short of 5 stars on this site and Disney.  
Eloise is so entertaining and I love the quirky things she says and does.
I do reccomend this kit - it's been awesome.  
Tinkerbell is downright malicious.  
Of course, it's easy to dramatize fear -- more-subtle emotions are harder to handle, and Disney often ignored them.
On the weekend I bought the DVD Combo Pack, I enjoyed the movie twice.
Just a little after Rabbit takes over leading and then in the cave after they split up until Christopher Robin shows up.
And every once in a while you hear a subject matter like a character choice or a song choice or lighting and it gives you an option on the screen on bottom to hit enter when you want to branch off and hear and see more on the subject, then it takes you right back to where you left off.  
Another great, funny episode.  
MY 2 year old grandson loves this classic movie.
A+This is my favorite Disney Afternoon boxset, at least until they release volume 2 (yeah, that'll be the day).
The doll is a little small, but she is the perfect size to be the Lambie doll of a bigger Doc doll.
I Am A Adult
I do love this movie I just wish the discs were more decorative and contained a digital copy disc.
Not a huge fan of cartoons or children's movies, but saw this with my nieces many years ago.
I enjoy watching this with my son!Thanks so very much!
They will only be putting out so many and you will need to put a 20% down so you can reserve one at many places.
This Toy Story "BULLSEYE" hasn't left my niece's side, since she got it.
I wanted to send it back and get another one
This is a cute calendar.
I am movie collector.
A collectible for his fans.
it's my 2nd favorite
Bambi was also one of my favorite soundtracks when Disney released it's vinyl back in the 60s, and they continue to sell on ebay, along with many other Disney original soundtracks.
This was no exception!
Guests and grandchildren love it.  
I love amazon.com and I will continue to purchase items through this website!
This was just the sort of thing that should have impressed the artsy-fartsy types who first praised Disney, then turned on him, but it appears not to have.
Good quality and didn't rip easily even when my daughter was pulling on them!
One is a breathtaking version of "The Little Match Girl" which is scrupulously faithful to the original story.  
Some 3D movies simply don't gain much thru the inclusion of 3D.  Furthermore, most movies that weren't originally created in 3D, don't really benefit that much after they've been transformed.  
The climax of the movie comes around when they have the meeting of pirates, The Brethren of the Coast (This is the one thing they actually took from real history.
And my niece has seen some of it before.
I thought this set of figurines would be something my daughter could play with in the tub with her "Bucky" ship.  
They have a circle, star, heart, and flower which is great if the pieces get mixed up you can easily organize them.
I may be a senior but I loved Finding Nemo.
How great is it that I can let my kids watch this without fear of what they might hear or see.  
One we will enjoy in our collection.
This is EXACTLY what my wife wanted for Christmas.  
This hamper put the final touch on our daughter's pooh-themed nursery.
***This review may contain spoilers***When "Monsters, Inc."first came out, some perceived a rivalry with "Shrek".  
Boo is adorable, and the story is compelling and fun.  
Originally, the Disney store had her for sale at $20, but I waited too long and they sold out.
I was holding off watching it for the longest time, and yet settling in to watch it over the past weekend was a complete joy.  
This was a gift to my grandson who loves it and his father,my son,loves it just as much.
I see nothing negative in trying to teach young girls to have confidence in themselves and to go after their dreams, to believe they can accomplish anything they want when they put their minds to it.
My kid loves planes
The package had absolutely no damage to it and it sealed nicely.
But my three year old loves it and it is light and compact so she can carry it around.
I so love Pixars stuff as for Disney is just amazing.
Got this for my grandson he loves it.
HOWEVER, as good of a movie as this is, the writers came up short...literally.
How imaginative to take a classic writing and make it into this classic animated movie!  
Great Winnie the Pooh Christmas story, that is often on TV, but now we can watch it anytime we want.
The Diamond Edition boasts an impressive amount of bonus material.
My daughter received this as a birthday gift, she's 5,  and it has really kept her busy since it has so many different scenes.  
I bought them because I really, really wanted to get him the cement truck (his favorite) and I couldn't find an individual one.  
Also it will not stand up on its own.
The only thing I don't like is that reading the card with the jewel is difficult.
My son wanted a Jake and the Neverland Pirates cake but none of the bakeries around me made them so I purchased this and got Publix to make me a Pirates of the Carribean cake without Depp and other features and placed them on top.  
Love that I can watch through TV with Roku, laptop & IPad.
There are many doses of humor - slapstick, low brow and high brow, in order to appeal to a wide variety of audiences.
Peter Pan is my all time favorite Disney classic.  
They can handle it over in Japan but we here in America can not.
It was an ok movie but not great.
A huge bowl of homemade caramel corn, and beverage of your choice have been found by our family to only enhance the viewing pleasure!
I had to buy this movie.  
this doll is of very inferior quality, they made changes in design and apparently to the dissadvantage of the doll.
Yep, this toy looks incredible up close.  
Tarzan has too many muscles on his body, it's more about the action, the music is lousy, and I don't like the story.
Now, one of my granddaughters likes to pretend she is a monster--she is not afraid of imaginary monsters.
Her other dressup dresses we own are simple to put on, and it really doesn't matter if they fasten or not.
I enjoyed what I got, but hoped for more.  
It is so beautiful and has many great special features.
This movie is based on a true story and really hard to stop watching.  
I bought a copy for Grannies house now we can enjoy it together.
Yes, of course share this with your kids and grandkids.
we like them and he has a lot of fun with them.
So happy to have this in HD digital to enjoy.
Monster's Inc. may scare very young children though, so you may want to screen this before letting your little ones see it.
They made the kitchen look so magical!  :-)
The cards are a bit smaller than I would have thought they would be for the age range on the game but the girls still do pretty well with them.
When I bought this for my nephew I never thought it will be so well crafted.
Bermuda Triangle Tangle:  Scrooge seeks to find out why his ships are disappearing in the Bermuda Triangle.  A+27.  
It has to be cleaned constantly and is stinky despite my wiping it down after each use and cleaning regularly with bleach.
I've tried to steer clear of scholarly answers that address that question.
My twin kids love this story.  
We loved it and are all in lvd with Dorie!This movie was a Godsend for our Mother who was in the last stages of Alzheimer's, she sat down and was still throughout the entire movie!
I don't want to make a false accusation against the seller, but I can't amagine Disney doing such a thing.
I recommend this anyday.
There's some great morals and spirituality in the film if you dig deep enough.
My grand-daughter simply loves it.  
I must not have paid attention to the size - this toy is BIG.
My Granddaughter,Ms Stella Leonora,loves to sing as it is,and once she received this DVD the other day, I am positive that her parents are about "crazy" as she played it twice the first day she received it!
Even with the cows, they are weak and easily spooked and Frank, the bull, is outraged and fearsome.
Whenever a character moves you see the bubbles in 3d also.
The top sheet has elastic at the bottom which is great for keeping it in place.
The girl stole the show & your kids will love her to buy it
In the mean time, Richard Goodwin, fresh out of law school, is working for a US congressman on the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee.
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for our housemate.
I never got around to purchasing a Blu-Ray after it was released, as I was pretty much only interested in new releases when I got my PS3.
It truthfully deals with bullies and braggarts and good winning out in the end.
This is the place I give my baby baths.
The sound quality is great and I never saw these cartoons look so good and vibrant!
It's a little long
Yes yes, I know, the message is not to judge people by beauty, but she's also beautiful on the inside.
Arrived undamaged and excited to watch it.
One of their Mother's commented that the doll was so nice for her daughter to sleep with because of the nice hair.  
One of the best comedies of the 90s.  
Special Features:Knick Knack Theatrical ShortAquariumCineExploreReInventing The Submarine VoyageDeleted Scene:
I see them from time to time but mostly there are those blah dolls that have very plain dresses and they are puffed in very non-traditional style that has nothing to do with character, and if you want original movie character go and find that Deluxe doll :)
Lightning McQueen with Racing Wheels is #3 in the Cars 2 line of "singles" (there's also #26, "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup Lightning McQueen"), and to be honest, it's all a little confusing to Grandpa & I, but our grandson knew the difference right off the bat!  
They need a bit of help, but really like Mickey, Minnie and the large-sized pieces!
Aside from that it's magical.
plus, i also remember having a huge crush on prince eric with whom ariel falls head over heels for and although he's a cartoon prince, he's really hot!
His arms are fully articulated.  
I bought this dvd for my grand babies.
proves that some of this stuff is very age dependent, my five yr old didnt get it
Then the kids took off the dress of coruse and the differenc was even more obvious, the body was so much stronger.
It was a hit with the family, so recommended!
Deadly Force:  Xanatos has a shipment of high-tech laser guns stolen from him.
Overall, this is a great gift for any Sofia the First fan.
A true-to-life teenaged mermaid wants to experience love and the other world.  
Sleeping BeautyV. Old YellerThe Story Behind Fun And Fancy Free
Always have liked this movie.
Our family was disappointed by the so-called "restoration" of the original classic.
One set has stars, circles, hearts, and sunshines.  
So after I rinse the soap off my daughter, I have to take her OUT of the soapy tub, dump the water, and rinse the soap off her.
My granddaughter is having as much fun rattling this wrapped package as I think she is going to have after she opens it.  
Brother Bear does not cover the screen, but in fact only covers about half the screen.  
Actually I purchased this to copy and send off to my grandchildren.  
Also included are a newly discovered Cheshire Cat song, "I'm Old," the animated cartoon "Thru the Mirror" starring Mickey Mouse, deleted scenes, storyboards, original song demos, and Walt Disney TV introductions from 1954 and 1964.
If you like this film, power to you.
Of course there is slightly more to the story than that, but that is the rough outline and gives an idea of what you can expect here.
The grandkids love it......and it's good for the grownups to sit down and watch with them, too..........
I also loved how they included some stars of Nascar as well.  
After my husband frantically ransacking his toolbox to find something to fix it temporarily because my children were crying in the backgound at why daddy took their new toy away ( i have twins).
This movie is a TON of fun to watch.
My wife and I watch this whenever it it on and now we can watch start to finish via Amazon Prime.
It's small, but she likes to carry it around in her pocket and brush her furry tail.
Go on this journey with Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew of very cool pirates!
It is also extremely humorous.
It reminds me of the cheap, flimsy, clear plastic bases that they put under cake toppers, only Clover's is yellow.
I like this soft doll, as my Granddaughter will probably want to take her to bed with her.  
And Disney always knows how to present it.
(And uncle Scrooge needs more love!)
The ending was the only part worth sitting through.
He like to pretend he is flying with his toy planes.
this is one of disney's best movie.
He's pretty durable for all the flopping around he's done here.
i purhased to replace my old vhs.
This is a movie that will be enjoyed by children as well as adults for generations to come.
This is another favorite movie from Disney.
Protection:  Elisa is acting strangely, so Goliath and Broadway go to investigate.
Other video problems include graininess within certain colors, especially yellows or gold, like Lumiere.
The puzzles excellent for my 7 and 4 year old grandchildren.  
The hidden pictures were hard to find on some of the cards and we had to use a bright light.
This was just unintelligible.  
Especially bath time, which shoud be relaxing.
we bought this our son and he loved it.
Down and Out in Duckburg:  A family debt causes Scrooge to lose his entire fortune, sending his entire family into the poorhouse.  
I took off one star because I personally thought the length is a bit long and children could have reaching and pulling them.
This dress is cute.
That being said, he's a bit top heavy (as to be expected) so he tends to topple over if you're not careful with his stance.
It was bought for me recently as a present and I was immediately impressed at the quality of the animation; you tend not to notice these things as a kid!
If your reading this you probably know the plot and if you like the movie.
These are good quality and the paint and coloring is good.
This film was created with a process called Deep Canvas (the creators of this rendering technique won a Technical Achievement Award in 2003).  
There are no lyrics and the music quality is horrible but that isn't a problem for my toddler.  
Another cute Winnie The Pooh movie for your Collection!  
Not sure what kind of "man" Bambi's dad making a token appearance in Bambi's life.
Magica's Shadow War:  Magica's plot to steal the Number One Dime using her own shadow goes awry when her shadow develops a mind of its own.  
SO BIG SHE DOESN'T FIT IN HIS BAG!!
We watch blu-ray mostly at home and then save our DVD's for the car.  
lots of places carry it.
I have no choice but to re-purchase another well copy of this film to keep.
My only problem with this film lies with the studios, who re cut the film, and fired McTiernan(uh Die Hard, anyone!!!!), while they sill managed to turn out a very entertaining film, I would love to see what the DIRECTOR of the damn picture wanted it to look like.
it was delivered as promised.
It's a really cute product, but based on the quality, I would steer clear.
It is well made...beware you will be singing along with it after awhile!!
Spider Man 3Avoid this trash @ all costs, and just buy the original with Brendan Fraser.
I recently bought a 3D player to go with my 3D TV and thought "why not, lets buy Nemo".  
even though the main characters are superficial and one dimensional, they are well done and feel very human, which is essential for a film mostly about dogs.this film is still a lot of fun today as it was in the 60's and 70's and it's definitely a must for any doggie/Disney lover.
I only with this is how it was still done.
The humor has a nice adult feel to it without being inappropriate and the animation is outstanding.  
The correct product was shipped and arrived on time.
Great for kids and the whole family.
Kenai goes to Koda's aid out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda's surprise.
When this come out, people used to draw everything in this cartoons...
In fact the film, like most Disney animated pieces, earns the G-rating and manages to pack some pretty intense sequences into the generally restrictive criteria.  
This movie is an instant classic sure to snap you out of the toddler film blues.
This is a great movie :)
In hand-drawn animation, the lines are everything.
This is an interesting time in history to watch The Insider again -- or for the first time -- knowing what you know about the events that happened since, particularly in big business and mass entertainment.
I do tend to see this set on sale quite a bit at Target, so check the price.  
We got the Toy Story one as well for my boy twin
I certainly will want to see Finding Dory in 2015.
The way this attractive version was done The Beautiful Paintings some executed on canvas with Bright Rich Thick Luscious Tropical Vegetation and all the Lush Colorful Flowers, the awesome way a lot of them are treated specially the evening/night backgrounds with different shades of Blue Colors so superbly Painted with most perfection and detail, and laid behind a Family of Lemurs with Piercing Bright Red Eyes staring at you, such a contrast and Great Art Work...
While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating.
No it doesn't jump out at you, but it's a very good conversation and worth 25-29 dollars.
It totally sucks.
So I purchased Olaf for my youngest one.  
All of a sudden, he was into cars and NASCAR, and a whole new world opened up.
I bought these for my granddaughter who is a Merida lover.
fits in the princess dream castle.  
Monsters Inc is: funny, touching, memorable, and just plain fun.
Basically, I think it should just have been left alone - you can't really improve on the TV series.  
My 3 yo son saw this at the store and has pretty much been hugging it ever since (three weeks ago).
Great toy in the Doc McStuffins collection for any 3yo.  
I'm also looking into buying the sequel too.
Oh well.. live and learn.
Unfortunately Disney only keeps them around 6 months or so before there back in the vault so take advantage of this offer!And I would also add that Amazon shipped me a replacement DVD after I found out my Blu-ray didn't work.
The Blu-ray release has commentary from historians.
The blanket also doubles as a superman cape :)
Perfect gift idea.
I love the oceanic settings and colors and of course...
I returned it.
But the songs and characters are great.
I know have it in 1080p and 3D, and cant ask for anything more.
I just do NOT like one of the major characters, Dory.  
Bought it on Saturday got it on Wednesday.
My daughter loves the sheets!
Not very entertaining at all I thought.  
I'm all for comedy and parodies, but it seems like people today (at least film and television writers) can't take romantic heroism seriously.
She loves it and plays with it.
Beleive it or not it is educational because they learn to memorise the songs and that is challenging for some.  
They suction cups do have a little trouble sticking, but this could just be the shape of my tub.  
After flipping through show after show of GARBAGE on the Cartoon Network I decided to invest in some of the older cartoon DVDs.  
Bottom line, is that this release is perfect, as far as the film is concerned.
This has always been a favourite you just cant beat the classics they are time less and need to be watched over and over
I love it!  
I really think there is a special place waaaaay down south (ehm) for people who gouge on toys.
I'm nearly 21 years old and I STILL think this is one of Disney's best movies.
Saw Cars 2 earlier this week and I am in the minority it seems who actually liked it almost as much as the first film.
She was Thrilled with this toy, Love Amazon and doing business with such good people!
Jennifer Garner's character is more three dimensional and less sex-object with a gun than a typical Angelina Jolie character, which I also approve of.
Hands down THE best bonus feature Disney has ever added.  
This was Walt Disney's favorite feature he made.
What can I say???
And besides, kind of like Little Mermaid, I thought it was too much of a girl's movie with the fairy tale, prince and princess, true love and all that stuff.
She really liked it.
We can share the Disney Magic.  
Fun and Fancy Free is enjoyable and gets an AAA+++.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionSet UpI.
I have seen this so many times I can probably recite the script word for word by now.
Unlike Sully, he's moving on to a relationship -- with the possibility of raising a family -- and he balances the circumstances of their contact with the world of children against his future with his girlfriend.  
Would recommend to all families.
Also, the little flap on his forearm only opens up about 1/4" and then falls right off - we have to keep putting it back on.  
I liked the movie, the second time aroundthere wasn't much action, actually, there was noneit was
I'm not going to really review this movie outside of saying it's a terrific movie and my all time favorite film.
A great movie for all ages!!
It does not seem totally secure.
I'm not sure if that was user error or a defect in the toy, but either way it's a bit upsetting.  
Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 3 is the perfect way to complete this DVD series and an excellent DVD for pre-schoolers. :)
Adorable and just the right size.
On the small side, but a little bigger than the color changers.
My daughter loves playing with her doctor bag.  
The nature of the film had a unique style, the use of the multiplane cameras also gave it a distinct look.  
I loved this movie when I was growing up and I am so happy that she loves it as much as I did.
but no thanks.
There are no color blemishes, artifacting, banding, DNR that takes away this visual presentation of this animated classic.  
The voice acting was incredible and the animation was great.
While I'm told Bandaras hates this movie, I think it's his best and his supporting cast was marvelous.  
A fight breaks out and the decision is soon made as the new king quickly slays his opponent for the throne.  
The movie plays absolutely great, however the packaging was from some library.
It is noteworthy to bring attention to the two marvelous extras on the second disk of this offering by Walt Disney.
He is going to flip over this movie.  
Our dtr grew out of the infant tub so we bought this hoping it would fit in our small tub.  
Of course, he hasn't asked to watch it again, so I wouldn't put it up there with his favorites.
Particularly for fans of the movie and Adam's novels who may have wanted more.
This disc has various extras on it, from sing along features, to a `making of' documentary but they are mainly aimed towards kids.
enough humor and antics for the grownups to not get bored.
Rushmore is one of those films you just have to see; you HAVE to.
The only flaw is the hat.  
Sword fights, romance, undead, fights, hig sea adventure, treasure and pirates!
The reason: Cars is a STRICTLY American film.
It is truly amazing at times, it even has a few times where something sticks out of the screen and the depth is always wonderful.
An excellent episode, with a great villain & script.  
I highly recommend this series to anyone wanting to watch a terrific series full of adventure.
I got volume two to complete my set!
Both children and adults will relate to Eloise.  
Sneak Peaks - Upcoming Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment releases and trailers for upcoming films from Disney.
Kids were thrilled when they first saw it, but when they couldn't shoot the arrow the first day, i never saw either one pick it up again.
HE LIGHTS UP, TALKS AND REALLY NICE SIZE FIGURE.  
She's gentle with her toys so that was clearly cheap construction and not from rough play.
All of his phrases are crystal clear lines from the movie, isolated for the toy.  
The animation is beautiful, particularly on bluray, and the voice cast is perfect.
I love the fact that i see Jada wear i suit from my University
As for this product, the video quality is perfect.  
Pros: These four puzzles are nice in size and the pieces are great for little hands.
Was easy to inflate and put on.
A few of the fairies have lost their wings from the abuse of a 3 year-old, but considering how many days, hours, baths, etc. they have been played with I am really impressed that they lasted a year and a half before she had anything brake on them.
Eye of the Beholder:  On Halloween, the Gargoyles go out into public while Xanatos proposes to Fox, giving her the Eye of Odin as a wedding gift.  
It arrived on time, as promised and we are very pleased with it.
It goes without saying that Marlon and Nemo eventually find each other, but it would be downright cruel to spoil it by telling you how.
In real history, arguments about British policy in India, including the latitude given to the East India Company, led to impeachment proceedings against Warren Hastings, the Governor of India, which was one of the most famous and longest running rows in parliamentary history.
We had fond memories of The Little Mermaid and this new Blu-Ray release brought many of those good memories back.  
I watch things with my granddaughter and I am really tired of the Care Bears.
Can't complain, video quality was decent, I just wish they would upgrade to 5.1 sound on the instant streams.
But the story is really good and touching.
Happily Ever AfterMrs.
Chilly arrived quickly (thank you Amazon!) and he looks exactly as described & pictured.  
Even my own kids when they were kids, they spent time watching and mind you, they were both hiperactive and would not last more than 10 minutes on a toy or movie but at least on Disney movies they lasted till the end of it.
It’s refreshing to see her going after something else besides Scrooge’s number 1 dime.  
And they wonder why our kids are such brats.
Galleria begins getting a big head because of all the fame but soon realizes that no one wants to be friends with her anymore because of it.
It's an original adventure and appeals to kids and adults.
I say loved because my dog chewed them all up.  
Back in 2003, when Finding Nemo hit the big screen, Pixar had a track record of only four prior feature films!
I loved watching this as a child, and now as an adult I love introducing it to my children to watch.
I woulod recommend this itm to be purchase to make a little boy very happy.
The pieces to the game were a little on the flimsy side and I don't think they would last a long time if they were played with often.
Even better in person!
It is different because it is about a mermaid
I wouldn't call it a classic, but it's definitely a heart-felt and genuinely moving story.
I ordered these for my son for Christmas, and he loves them.
Love the soundtrack and the storyline is clever.
I told her that I get them because they can easily burn on Magic DVD Ripper as it automatically removes restrictions like Region Code.
While I adore Anne Hathaway, her version of Princess Mia is nothing like the spunky kind of outcast like girl (who might I mention has blonde hair, not brown hair) that was presented in the books and I grew to adore.
the plus side this is a really great collection of Walt's lesser known works, but I was amazed at how many of these shorts I remembered, but had been long forgotten.
The animation in this movie is incredible.
For the younger crowd, Disc One contains interactive games and activities ("Virtual Wonderland Party" and "Adventures in Wonderland") which can be played using the remote control.  
And what a movie for dads!
If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
Takahata represents the more realistic side of Studio Ghibli.
On the other hand, as I said, my daughter did enjoy it, and in the end Princess Mia and Genovia do come to their senses.
I am glad that I waited to watch it though
Immediate impressions can be deceiving.
She enjoys using the teeny tiny instruments on her sick patients, Mom included.
I love Walt Disney's way of thinking when it comes to romance.
An old man who cant have a child of his own.
Perfect condition and can enjoy for a long time with my grandkids one day!
He had played with it at our weekly play group for a while so we knew the "like" factor was there.
and it is always clean.
But now I can thanks to the DVD I got.
I did have this in VHS for my kids and they enjoyed it
Big hit though.
The movie's also got wonderful design of its French setting and characters, with the ballroom scene a standout (the tiny but appreciative audience were impressed by the sight of the Beast and Belle in their evening wear - the only time I've ever seen cartoon characters get wolf-whistled in a cinema); and Alan Menken's score is his finest work for the Mouse, with matchless lyrics from the late and much lamented Howard Ashman - how many musicals can you name where ALL the songs are brilliant?
mini me, jake gyllenhaal's funniest move ever, a must watch.
Besides that I liked this move and several  others I bought  some Disney some
No video library is complete without this movie.
Got this little guy for my daughter who is almost 3.
The accessories are cheap and not worth much - I swapped them out for $0.99 pieces from Party City which were much better.
This brought me back to my childhood-I remember seeing this movie in the drive in when I was seven years old.
She has a very nice little prince outfit which comes with a hat but the hat doesn't really stay on his head, which wasn't really a big deal to us.
As a perant I aspecially like that this toy has a volume control.
This one has become a family must have.
I haven't really bothered with much of the bonus features because my daughters usually just watch the movie.  
My DD loves it.
This is based on the book Eaters of the Dead.
These mentions and credits would be pointless though, if the animators did not put forth their greatest efforts.
I generally prefer Hayao Miyazaki films to those of Isao Takahata, but even though Miyazaki was only minimally involved with this film, it is among of my favorites from the studio.
I would agree with other reviewers that this doll feels sturdy and well made.
Isn't it strange how what's acceptable changes over the years?The high-definition transfer for "Peter Pan" looks and sounds excellent.
No problem for kiddie viewers.  
They are just the right size for a little one to take on and off her arms.
This movie will capture audiences of all ages.
My nephew first saw both of them when he was 10 years old.  
The packaging is very nice.
Antonio Banderas outdid himself with this show.  
Much larger than expected .
Who doesn't love this movie?!  
The phrases he speaks are true to character sound and movie.
But we later learn the danger she worries about is Man.**
Lots of nostalgic music too.
Even though this an older movie, it is great for the whole family.
the dress although appear the same - beware, the fabrics are way cheaper and not as thick and fine and glisteningly perfect on this one,t hey look very alike on picture but very differnt in reality.
There is no compression artifacts, no banding, no scratches or dust, it looks perfect!If you love this film, you definitely need to upgrade to Blu-ray because "Bambi" looks fantastic in HD!Because the film is presented in 1:33:1, once again, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment brings back the "DisneyView" featuring the art of Lisa Keene, so instead of the black bars on the side, you can opt for colorful artwork that matches the scenes of the film.
That's OK, it's a classic plotline, but the way it all plays out gave me a distinctly uncomfortable feeling.
already a favorite with both of my boys.
Can't go wrong!
She loves it .  
Good family fun, no blood, no cursing.  
Such a great change from normal happy smiling plushes.
Walt Disney did make a powerful compromise by having Gepetto paint a smile onto Pinocchio.  
The feature Growing Up With Nine Old Men was especially enjoyable and a fitting tribute to Disney's finest animators.
I thought 3d to be a gimmick, but I find that it really draws me into the movie.  
I should have read the reviews before purchasing this item.
I watched the Japanese version with the English subtitles.
Being the inclusive dad that I am I would watch it with him.
I was hypnotized!
It is a perfect blend of mischief, stubborness, and most importantly, youth.
The kids love their woody doll, the only problem is that we have 3 kids and 1 doll- I'll be getting Buzz and Jesse too!
If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
The dvd is as good as ever.
I enjoy animated films.
I found mine and it was titled Disney store deluxe doll.
It's so great to have my own version, so I can watch it whenever I want!
Does show how some animals have adapted to humans.  
I feel like it was a good buy, as a mother, for my daughter someday to have.
i couldnt stop watching it.
I have the DVD but back then they didn't have digital copies!
Painting the Roses Red Game - Help paint the roses red in the Queen's garden.
i will update how good 3d was after tonight.
The horse used in these movies is nothing short of AWESOME!  
I love love love this movie, so does my baby, and definitely one of my husbands favorite.
The Peter Pan Story - Original 1952 Theatrical Promotional FeaturetteIII.
I'm very happy.
That cake infuriates me.  
Lightning is a self-described "one man show" who wants to win the big race in order to get the big bucks and the big endorsements, and has perhaps cheated to make his way into the run-off race.
But as I make my fourth comparison in this review, A Low Down Dirty Shame isn't in the same class with those movies of it's genre that I mentioned.
but I'm expecting the wings to break off at some point.  
She saw the Ariel had a pet and just had to have it.
The great thing about a great film is its ability to elicit a nostalgic response in addition to taking on a new meaning with each new viewing.
The second issue is with Amazons packaging.
We also meet my favorite character, the Cheshire Cat.
I will be buying from this seller again.
Like my niece has never before heard about Ferraris.
Arrived on time, Great condition as always, I've loved Peter Pan since I was a little girl.
I watched both the dvd and blu-ray version just to see if I could tell the difference.
Definately a dissapointment since most Disney Blu-rays thus far have been incredible.  
I cannot say enough great things about this movie and how well it was done!
**I received the Dazzling Princess Game from Wonder Forge.  
I like it to because Boo is so cute.
Also, the movies on this DVD set are condensed.
Good quality, deep and wide enough, easy to inflate.
I had to buy the series when I found it for sale.
And if the spell can only be broken if he can fall in love before his 21st year.
My boys can't get enough of the race day, the surround sound of cars zooms!
This disc also includes Louis Armstrong and female guest singing and playing music on uproaring performance on the Mark Twain with Disneyland guests all huddled aboard to watch the once in lifetime musical act.
First off, this is the first Disney direct-to-video movie I've ever seen that felt like it had actual effort put into it.
Larry the Cable Guy as Mater the tow truck easily steals the show, but does it in such a way where you absolutely know it's Larry doing the voice, but you see Mater as a character in of itself rather than a cartoon Larry.
They are able to use any form of intimidation to keep them in line.
Very thoughtfully developed story line.
These are not trivialized by successful persons.
He loves the movie and was excited to get the toy.
Wanted this on dvd before the mermaid went back in the disney vault
A High Profile Preview2.
NO ONE CAN COME CLOSE TO THEIR PRICES.THIS FEATURE IS WORTH THE MONEY.
The songs, however, miss the mark completely.
The full cycle of life is also experienced within the collective cast of characters.
Unfortunately the crown headband was very small and wouldn't stay on my daughter's head without several hairpins.  
The first ride we always go on at California Adventure - Ariel!
I have seen a lot of reviews regarding some of the themes of the story being negative but if you consider the time this was created it makes sense.  
Bought this for my 3 yr old.
The material is so soft and the ears have something inside to keep their round shape.  
He takes after my dad who worked for TWA for 35 years
It's a really funny movie that makes a strong statement about coming to terms and accepting yourself, despite of your flaws.
Beauty is one of the many she received this past Christmas, and is her second favorite--right after Treasure.  
In this film, Nemo can't seem to understand his father, and ends up being caught by a fisherman.  
And with this film now being released on Blu-ray, I do have to say that this is one of the most beautiful classic animated film from Disney on Blu-ray thus far.  
And if you don't have a blu-ray player this is perhaps the movie you buy one for.
Love Winnie the Pooh.
No bad quality or pixilization at all.
This movie is pretty good.
And while its last two songs are more a part of the 1940s period in which it was first released, the first two, "Love is a Song" and "Little April Shower," are masterworks, in their composition and execution.
Would not recommend this.
I thought it was the 2nd scariest Disney movie in my life, behind Aladdin.
Black Stallion was a really good movie, I liked the horse races and the actors were very nice, this is a very awesome Disney film !
It is just greatto watch for the costumes and special effects.
Was not as good the second timearound.  
If she was as crazy as the rest it simply would not work.
I grew up with Toy Story, and they really hit their stride with flicks like Finding Nemo and WALL-E. Cars, though?
This was the 28th animated film to be released by Disney Studios and the first of ten movies of the Disney Renaissance era (1989 to 1999).
They are sometimes also available on the Disney Store web site for that price, but this is a new set and may not be on there yet.
She hated it, prefers Shrek.  
I have many favorites scenes, and I am happy to own it in my collection. :)
Its an epic show that doesn't treat kids like idiots.
Who would guess we would be entertained by a red and a blue fish and have all the emotions of real-life flow through us by watching a cartoon.
The CDs are way too small, not mentioned anywhere here, but they are 2" in diameter.  
My 3 yr.
His legs can be positioned.
Several actors reenact the parts of Walt and the others involved in the film and you are literally transported in time and is like being in those meetings with them.
The best "recent" Disney was during this time when political correctness had not been slipped in.
Answer is NO.
Releasing Frozen almost at the same time as the Ashman lecture is curious indeed, because Disney could have followed his advice, particularly in regards to the main song Let It Go, and would have had a much better movie.
It's all amazing!Rating: 5 stars/5 stars
but this is the first time I have owned it on Blu Ray and let me tell you this is the best it has ever looked.
I love the original BBC mini series despite the horrific special effects....
It is a magnificently well done look back at the time that this and other classic Disney films were being made.  
I liked the TV shows because it gave endless possibilities to see the characters of the kids.
It matches all the other Doc McStuffins toys she has already.
Very few of the plush toy story characters are cute.
Nemo, is such a sweet movie, great for the whole family, and as usual, with a nice moral..
The Blu-ray comes with a DVD, which is quite convenient, so watching it in High-def, which is noticeable, or just watching it is very simple.  
I have enjoyed watching volumes 1 and 2, but Disney is lazy about releasing the third volume.
and she loves it...
It says all the same phrases from the movies (there's a snake in my boot is my favorite).
Prisoners are tortured and mistreated.
The animation was amazing too!
The Little MermaidIII.
He is wiggly woogly fun!
If you have never seen this movie its heart warming and its a must see movie.
Still Frame Galleryb.
His clock face will come through & "bloom" over most of the lines on his face, losing most of the detail.
My grandchildren really like to watch this movie
So when the tub fills up with water the bumpers start to float.
the Pirates of the Caribbean series is one of my favorites, in this one jack and the rest come face to face with none other than the dread Davy Jones and his crew and set sale on his fabled vessel the Flying Dutchman
and I kind of miss that.
Like in many Disney movies, there's lots of singing and animal friends.
That doll is out of this world gorgeous.
The ridiculous plot makes little enough sense if you can put it into the context of the rest of the trilogy.
The picture shows trees and all that on the potty, but the one I received has Pooh and the other character on it.
Thumper still remains the star of this little masterpiece.  
As an adult I find this film very charming, and a pleasant way to wile away the afternoon.
The symbolism used to show the feelings of the rich vs the daily misery of the poor and how they come together to face a challenge ~ understood by all who dream ~  There is more than one hero in the film including the mountains themselves ~ A very beautiful film and good story.
Lighthouse in the Sea of Time:  MacBeth steals a set of scrolls, supposedly written by Merlin himself.  
I didn't see all of the same episodes that I remember from my childhood, I know it's only Volume 1, but where is the Pilot! ep??
He just loves to enter the world of monsters.
But they're backseated by far too many indulgent side-treks and wink-nod-grins for anyone's good.
old grandson's very favorite Toy Story character, and he wanted it so badly...
It's a light hearted film that you can kick back and watch that will remind you how the 90's turnt out some films that are memorable.  
On the surface the Finding Nemo formula is pretty simplistic, almost too linear for my own tastes but a little deeper examination reveals a pretty solid grasp of the complex relationship between a father and son; one in which all that remains of a once-thriving family (with 399 siblings) is one another.
Really cute with a tiny pocket inside - I think to hold the pom poms.
The outside of the box indicates that this should fit a 4-6x child.  
Many live-action films are transferred from the composite or camera negative, which improves image quality to a level not seen in theaters, and no one complains.
It's a shame that the studio seems to disregard these selections from this time period because I think restored versions for the 6 films during this period could be put into one Blu Ray box set  and maybe entice Disney fans to purchase these forgotten little gems.
It works great.
All-in-all, it's a sweet little game, that should stand up to repeated play by most little ones.  
We have never had any problems with it and our 2 year old can name almost all of the characters
It reminds me of myself.
My son really likes this one, it calms him down, and often puts him into a state of nap which is perfect for mom!!!
He imitates the characters and seems to relate to chicken little!
It was made from cheap plastic and cardboard
good, clean movie for kids who can learn American history in the process.
The dress and cloak are gorgeous.
He almost always laughs or smiles at the noise of the swirling water.
This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen.
If Disney is going to release a film and call it restored, then they should be honest and actually DO IT.
I wasn't sure how good this would be, but I am glad I got it.  
Several times pieces of a line will disappear into the color behind it.
This will be my second time reviewing this product....hopefully no one complains about this one to get it knocked off, if it does, oh well.
In the beginning she says "Stop following me!"
It's so funny and heartwarming.
Ghost of a Chance: The Rescue Rangers trail Fat Cat to London in order to prevent him from stealing the crown jewels, and, in the process, discover the ghost of one of Monty's long-dead ancestors.
It conserves water and its' great for travel.
It's a cute back drop for the characters.  
I've purchased collector Barbie's that were better than this.
At least we still have Cars.
Antonio Banderas is wonderful as the Arab scholar and true believer.
I like this movie because of its portrayal of the primitive times in which the Anglo-Saxons lived.
it's kinda extraordinary how the world of two leggers translated so smoothly & so well to the world of four wheels.2 big thumbs up & 2 little uns. :)
But that's not why you are here to read this review so I'll try to provide more useful info.
The 3D work was wonderful.
Thanks so much!
I like that, though.
You could actually take it seriously at least, but Elizabeth's high pitched voice screeching a pep talk kind of ruined the martial effect of the battle scene.
Buy it twice.
I think this has more to do with the fact that filmmakers chose to name the great white shark Bruce in homage to the mechanical one Steven Spielberg used while directing "Jaws."
I didn't really have expectations for it.
Every one knows the movie.  
If your child ends up mixing up all the pieces then they are easy to sort and separate because of the mark on each piece.
Its cute for the kids.
A great Disney classic, highly recomended
Although not my favorite Disney movie, i was very glad to add this to my collection!
Amazon refunded my money immediantly and I was very happy about that, that's why I do most of my shopping on this site.
It was a good deal for the price, but these figures really are not well made.
The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.******I
This movie has a great message to deliver.  
The only complaint is that it has a detachable sheet music stand and my daughter lost it.
So even with all my grievances, I guess I still can't help but be lured into Rushmore's undeniable charm.
i would like to see disney do another hand drwan movie.
My 16 year old grew up loving Finding Nemo and that same love is now being passed to my 5 year old.  
He spends the bulk of the movie slipping in and out of this false persona, pulling faces the crooks never catch onto even though they're many and never varied.  
It's her second favorite, just behind Cinderella.  
The colors are vibrant, there is no pixilation, the sound is phenomenal, and the disk is bursting with bonus content.
I would recommend this to all my friends.
I don't know why
It's great to give a girlfriend a DVD as a gift, but get one for yourself as well.  
It's a classic Disney film, what else?
Despite its age ( I remember being moved by this film as a child and that was over 50 years ago)it still delivers.  
(exaggerating, but not much)
The contents are cute and durable, though, and my son liked it.  
I got this while it was on sale, and so I am even happier with my purchase - another buyer mentions Maximus from "Tangled"...we also have that one, and this is of equal, if not better quality.
Now I have a grandbaby who gets to watch it on a big screen TV and in high definition.  
How could kids even find the games let alone play them.
This movie is a keeper with Paul Newman as Doc Hudson.
The packaging for this figurine set was terrible.
This was excellent  a true classic.  
MY son loves this bedding.
I have watched with grand babies like I did with my kids.
Once again, Disney continues to aim for perfection and again, Disney has achieved it!AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"Alice in Wonderland:
While I imagine that, eventually, some of the jewels will go missing, this game was a lot of fun.  
If Disney keeps releasing their classics in 3D I will continue buying them.
I personally would not purchase this for a very young child because it would be very easy to destroy the points of articulation.
Love Walter Farley stories.
Who doesn't like Nemo?
…this had earmarks of being produced without having a full appreciation of the spirit of the original material.
It's the last of Disney's films to use actually hand-painted animation cels - save for a few shots where the pioneering CAPS digital coloring system was utilized - so this is likely why it looks a bit more dated than it is.
The acting was brilliant, the music was good and generally the movie's message was very inspiring.
(They feel like decorative figurines more than toys designed for play).
I can't wait to get the rest of the series.
Still, Cars is a really good movie with great animation, voice cast, characters and a good story.
Each peice comes on a circle stand so they can't really be played with.
A Classic movie that everyone enjoys to watch.
Can Marlin and Nemo survive their misadventures and reunite with each other?This is another example of a Pixar film I just don't enjoy.
I so recommend the DVD or Blu-Ray of the movie.
There are about 45 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 17 around 25%.
It has the feel of something crafted by true artistic masters.
This is a classic.  
I NEVER would have seen this on a shelf and bought it for this price.
I have been really enjoying looking at Pom Poko and the other movies like it.  
Be nice if Little Mermaid episode Beach could be on one of these sets or Aladdin episode CHAOS.  
I went through some of the samethings these kids went through when I was in junior high and high school.  
Definitely worth it.
he gets put on notice... then vanishes...
I have to wonder if any of his stories were adapted for this show?  
Not to mention, this release features some new great special features that give you insight into how the film was animated by studying actors who acted out the whole movie on a small set.
Over all I give this title 5 stars because if you don't care about bonus features and just want to see the film in the best possible picture and hear crisp clear sound than you should not deny yourself this chance to own a wonderful piece of Disney animation.
Get the popcorn out and grab a drink but try not to laugh and drink at the same time.  
Have watched it twice now.
Finding Nemo, unlike it's Pixar predecessors, is set almost entirely in a watery environment and it certainly feels that way.  
This is an older version and my kids loved it so got it for the daycare.  
Only the usually reliable James Donald, who specialised in playing the understated voice of reason in tales of obsession like Bridge on the River Kwai, is a bit more awkward playing outside his comfort zone as the stern, occasionally belligerent uncle, but it's more a performance that occasionally wavers in the wrong direction before righting itself than one that hurts the picture.
My 17 month old daughter likes it, and it appears well made...but there is NO DRAIN!
They were much bigger then I expected which is great for a younger child.
Granddaughter loves it.  
She really likes this movie and I was happy to get it for her because I know what it means to her.
Anyone expecting the real voices to return are asking for a bit much, and I'm glad the studios did make these features not simply as a gimmick, but a real creative follow up that flatters the real thing with fresh material and interesting original characters.
I love this movie, and having it in every version imaginable was the most sensible choice.
The worst thing about "Last Flight of Noah's Ark" though, is the horrible late 70's/early 80's theme song.
The pictures are vibrant and very cute.
but the way they stand, sort of awkwardly and the looks they give each other are really moving.
Same with George Carlin as the hippy van (it's probably the only role I've ever liked him in).Not only is the cast great, but the story is fantastic.  
Such movies are so well done and deliver the message that almost any scenario can be brought over the line to win, with a bit of humor and creativity and action and faith hope love!  
But I'm not 100% sure this is what they did, as this halo never appears on any of the backgrounds.
We love him!
The hat does not want to stay on though.
In the six months since she has gotten it she has used it in some way almost daily.  
Sally was a positive & nice character from the movie & we really like her.  
When we meet Bruce for the first time..
Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.  
Walt Disney was one of the few undisputed giants of popular culture, along with those amazing Brits Charlie Chaplin and John Lennon.
The Little Mermaid II Return to the Sea* The Tigger Movie* Toy Story 2PlayVHS PREVIEW*
I don't care whether it is true to the book, as I haven't read it.
Most of the students have rich parents, but Max's father is a barber and Max has to lie and claim that he's the son of a brain surgeon in order to gain acceptance.
Though it didn't end up winning that battle, it was still an amazing series.
I will watch it again and again.
A wonderful, funny film.
Of course the song became a #1 hitin the USA.  
Without Docent Audio6) Tricks of the Trade (excerpt)7) Inside The Disney Archives8)
Puzzles tend to get put together once and then kids are done with them.
the episodes make no sense, ala James Bond.
A true Disney classic, the story of a young Indian turned into a bear by the great spirits.
nice to see some good role models for kids, especially in this day and age.
Finding Dory is supposed to come out in the next few years (2016) so make sure that you see this movie first.
Bill Murray plays a grumpy divorcee who captures some of those same traits, giving us a movie with foil.
We bought this toy at a local Kmart and my daughter loved it, but we noticed that the stethoscope only lit up..didn't talk or anything.
It's a great story and my son loves watching them on Amazon.
Eventually I'll own the entire series.  
but most importantly, think of it as a fun way to kill a few hours.
I understand some of the negatives (typical "idiot dad" scenerio and so forth).  
That's not even a third of the volume.  
They go everywhere with us...in the house, car, plane...
I rewatch this one two or three times a year.
I have tested this film on two different types of televisions and suffice to say, this film doesn't look 60-years-old at all.  
Cliff referred to it as 'effing.
the lunchbox is!
This is a really great video for children who are just learning their numbers.
As the story always goes, the book is better.
I suggest not bringing them in to the bathtub.
It is jot as good as I remember it but is still enjoyable.
If you are not into princesses, then this really is not the right game for you!
It's about knowing what is right or wrong and teaching your children and having them learn from it.
and I love the idea that laughter is more powerful than fear.
We also immediately meet Thumper (the rabbit) and Flower (the skunk), who would become Bambi's lifelong friends and share adventures together.
You can set it automatic or manually punch in the content.
Now she is always wanting to watch this movie :)
The Transformation: Pencil Version4.
Granted, Cinderella had to stand next to Prince Charming, whereas Belle's comparison is the "horrible, hideous Beast!"The story, in short (spoiler alert! -
Of course, once they get the place in order, Lightning's their hero.
Received this DVD in a very timely fashion and in excellent condition.  
It also reminded my of the passage of time as most if not all of the guest appearances are by performers who are no longer with us.
The quality of the box was excellent and the DVD works perfect.  
It goes everywhere with him.  
paint is rubbing of of certain areas of 1  or 2 of them2.
Mr. Dennehy acts like a crazy-man, and engages in a good-natured rant about residents in suburbia being bored to death.  
I'd say Season 2 is the definitive season of the show without question.
I MADE A MISTAKE SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT TWO BECAUSE THEY NOW FIGHT OVER THIS DOLL
This little tub worked great on our family cruise.  
It is cheap and flimsy.
Seriously, Frozen frenzy has people charging outrageous prices.
oh lordy this is one of my fave disney movies once again when they come to visit .
I bought this movie before I even had kids and now that I had kids we watch it all the time and none of us ever get tired of it!
After the battle is won by the pirates (just destroying one ship) all the pirate ships cheer like they've been working hard.  
It's fair enough as simple but not too fantastic family entertainment, but there are much better out there under the Disney name.
This film is a fantastic survival story.
It uses all the aspects that make a Disney classic timeless to the best possible way.
Highly recommended indeed.
Since she has never seen the english version I don't know how well it is translation wise, but in it's original context and Japanese this is another Family favorite.
I did not have the pleasure of watching this movie, although it is one of my favorites.
Look for some pretty biting social satire in the march of the villagers up to the Beast's castle to kill him.
Especially good on Blu-Ray which I found to be reasonably priced.
Didn't get this when it came out so I was glad to get it to complete our collection we love it
I'd never seen them before, so I bought the set to view what was at least available.
It would be exciting to pull out during a small party or sleepover.
Such as a clamshell for Ariel, and a monkey for Jasmine.
Exploring the Reef* Studio Tour* Old School* Outtakes* Deleted Scenes* Publicity Pieces*
You'll see things you never noticed, and you'll be amazed at how beautiful the movie is.
The princess balls were a little lonely with only girl dolls.
The 3D adds amazing depth to this movie.  
Good movie nice for collection.
I hated the casting of the two leads - Martin Freeman and Mos Def... they are good actors but they have no on screen chemistry.
This stuffed animal is clearly made well.  
To Peter Pan, anything is possible.
Once again, a relic from my youth!
It is his traveling buddy.
Netflix = DVD copy only].
would recommend it again.
A must have for any fan, child, or collector.
(yeah I had to say it).
It is on her headband, doctor bag and doctor accessories and her shoes.  
I'm surprised its rated G.
Carried from the Platinum DVD is the fantastic making-of documentary "The making of bambi: A Prince is Born", a excerpt of a Walt Disney TV show where he explains the use of the multi-plane camera, the animated short "The old Mill", two deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.
I had him with me while picking up a few things at the grocery, they had a display of them, and he immediately called out, "LIGHTNING!!!"  
In the past, the special features were all separated but the way its done on "Bambi", they were combined as one full special feature.  
For example, I completely missed the pederasty implications of "Pleasure Island," where the bad boys are taken and do not come back -- at least as boys.
I've never seen this before and I can't believe I never thought to do this myself!  
I think its way overpriced for being such a flimsy product, but hey, its the 'name' you pay for.
the box cover Say's that the series digitally remastered
My niece really likes this movie.
I use clips from the movie to reinforce the teaching of the culture in which Beowulf was written.
Maid of the Myth:  Mrs. Beakley is abducted by Vikings and it is up to Scrooge and the others to rescue her.  
Dame Julie Andrews delivers more of her finest as Queen Clarissa, batting heads with the Genovian royale in attempt to defend Mia's "unfortunate" (unwed) disposition as head in-line to the royal throne.
The kids and I loved it.
There was such excitement as we unpacked the characters.  
i do have to say this, Disney does not make'm like this anymore.
Don't believe it.
Hilarious scene between Johnny Depp and Keith Richards.
Donald can no longer take care of the boys because he wants to join the navy so he turns to his uncle Scrooge for help.
My daughter loves it.
Since these are line drawn cartoons, I'm not at all certain that the Blu-ray process could provide much additional visual data.
He also turns off on his own when his paw isn't pressed after a few minutes by saying "ttfn, ta ta for now".
This arrived on time and in perfect condition.  
Monsters has taken the fear that we grew up with that a monster is under our bed and intentionally or not the writers and producers have done an excellent job of making bed time fun.
The process is more problematic for the characters.
My introduction to HGTTG was via the BBC TV series, then the books, so I suppose that biases me in a big way.  
When Disney contacted him to do a few films, he did Robin Crusoe USN and Never a Dull Moment.  
She loved it so much that she always wanted to sleep in it.
This movie, however, was surprising fresh.
Monsters Inc. is widely recognized as one of the greatest Pixar films ever made, and it's there are several reasons why.
Too bad it doesn't have a long tongue.
Love this movie!!  
I think it helps the children to not be scared of the dark or what is underneath the bed.
Like many of the Blurays I've covered from Disney lately I do find a few annoyances that may or may not bother you.
I had the original DVD of this & lost it.  
The rest of the casting is just awful, this was an un-needed remake, the BBC series is perfect and needs no changes what so ever.
I didn't expect any more than that though.
Also, I found out that there are two other games just like this one called "Discovery Garden Game" and "Dr. Seuss One Fish Two Fish Game"; which are great if you have a son who probably isn't interested in the little mermaid.
I remember watching this when I was little and loved it back then.........and still do.
One was made to be released in theaters whereas the other went straight-to-DVD.
It's got something to do with the moments in-between.
Such a great family movie to show monsters in a different light.  
I am glad I was able to get it for my kid to add to his collection :)
She was a real bargain for the quality and craftsmanship involved.
I absolutely LOVE the muppets!!!
The action-comedy movie can be successful and the genre has churned out some good movies such as Beverly Hills Cop 1 and 2, both Bad Boys, all three Rush Hour movies, All About The Benjamins, and Money Train.
He's waiting to get all the volumes of DuckTales.
I'm very satisfied.
I only have to put them up when other kids come over as they tend to use each other as the bear.
This movie is really a silly movie, but if you want to watch something really funny with some idiot dialog, then this is the movie for you.
and I think it will last us into a bigger girl bed.  
It's got several musical cartoons on it which are fairly short and great for my primary aged students.  
I trust having it around my younger child since all the pieces are sewn on well.
The colors are duller than "Alice", but of course this is the way the original film was.
There aren't too many Doc McStuffins toys out there yet and this is a this is a nice one with lots of characters.
This is the first 3D Disney Movie that I've seen and I loved it so much I got all the available ones so far.
He is well made and holds up to frequent play.
This is a rare car to find in stores.
I assured her all ends well.
It looks like the original animation layers were redone such that foreground layers and the background were redone twice over, once for the left eye and once for the right eye, which works quite well.
I did!!
My daughter was very happy with it.
This is my wife and my favorite Disney movie.
Because of this, the movie has always skipped or frozen.  
Yes the "Winning isn't everything" message is in a million movies but I loved it here.
I'm even going to repurchase some of the newer ones that I got that wasn't in 3D, since I didn't have the TV at the time.
I always cry whenever I watch this movie, and that means that it's still as heart warming as it was when it first came out.
and they also loved it .
Not only is she funny
This movie is an instant classic!
Production Features include:Two Full Length Commentaries: One is by Lasseter and the other with the production team (with pictures).Inspiration for 'Cars'*:
Nobody will be disappointed with the appearance of this 60th anniversary Blu-ray edition.
The animated sea-creatures actually somewhat like they would in real life.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a faithful adaptation of the previous versions of the story told in the radio, book, and television adaptations of Douglas Adams' story.
I love how Disney does things right.
One of the last good series on TV.  
It's an interesting look at problems within the US education system along with being an entertaining movie.
This doll does and the quality is great.
The first season is priced great but be prepared season 2 comes in two volumes and it gets pricey but still worth it.
and I still like it that is why I bought it.
SPECIAL FEATURES:"Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition" comes with the following special features presented in HD (note: original DVD features that are on the Blu-ray are presented in standard definition):DISC 1:* Audio Commentary - Audio Commentary for the special extended edition is included.  
This tragedy sets a point of no return for Bambi, and he has to learn about leadership from his father.
I haven't bothered to compare with the DVD version, so it's possible they played with the saturation/brightness but if they did, it was for the better.
I would send it back, but we live overseas and it took long enough for him to get here besides the trouble it would be sending it back to the States to Amazon then getting a replacement sent all the way back here.
Normie's Science Project:  Normie uses his Uncle Nimnul's record player which uses sound to disintegrate objects as a science project.  
$18 for this classic on Blu ray is a steal.
The importance of friendship and the fact that life is a fleeting thing that should be enjoyed while we have the opportunity.
I bought the Woody doll and Jesse Doll that would fit this Bullseye.
They're SUPER durable, and we know they'll be around for him to pass along to his own kids one day!  
If she will fall in love with him he can become a man again.
I wish they did a combo pack with the 1st and 2nd movie like they did with The Fox and the Hound movies.  
But frankly, I was seriously disappointed.
You can tell the 'Nemo' filmmakers love the ocean and all the miracles hiding within.
Of course all parents and grandparents will enjoy (again) as well.
i don't worry about him hitting his head on the spout as this has a nice amount of inflation (much better than other designs i have seen).
The problem is Verbinski lacks a certain level of restraint.
Have seen the little Mermaid since my 28 yr old daughter was young.  
Beast (Robby Benson) must find true love by his 21st birthday in order to lift the spell.
Very similar to "The Great Mouse Detective" combined with "The Rescuers 1 & 2" and Scooby Doo, this is a very creative and popular show that has earned another fanbase like Gummi Bears and Ducktales.
The colors are vibrant, the blacks are nice and deep and the character designs and animation look absolutely cute but also its lines are absolute clean.  
Sized for an infant...Bought as a baby shower gift.
The kid never looks comfortable while going potty.
Got the Tangled and Beauty & the Beast discount deal so I saved $10 bucks with buying both and I haven't even seen Tangled yet lol...
If you have a previous version of this movie, it is definitely time to upgrade and get this blu-ray version.
Adam plays with real cars as if they were toy cars and he plays with Hard Rock Cafe's giant guitar!
You also have deleted scenes, a game, the shorts One Man's Band and Mater and the Ghostlight, the inspiration for the movie and more.
I could not allow that to happen!
Very entertaining day.
She does this puzzle over and over again.  
Then this is a great set to get!
Clean and good, not completely painful for Mom and Dad.
It has Antonio Banderas in it.2- Loved the landscape, gorgeous.3-
Catch As Cash Can:  Scrooge and Glomgold compete in a contest where the winner, being the world's richest duck, becomes the sales broker for a new fruit from Macaroon that works like a flashlight.  
And there was airplanes like the movie.
I never seen vol 1 or 2 of this group
She usually places it next to her lego Cinderella castle and the people all end up there!
My son is in love with this movie.
Not sure what movie those 1 star folks were watching, but if it was this one, they must have been doing something else at the same time.  
This is a must have for any true Toy story fan!
However, they don't always work.
The extras are very well played in this release.
Hence there are reviews - 389 before this one - going back to 1999 (!) when it came out on VHS!
the picture and sound is great and i love this movie a lot.
James base was very flimsy, and he wobbles slightly, even though the base is still in tact.
It is a classic so it's a must have for our collection.
She wore it to a dinner and jousting at Medieval Times and had a blast.
Love this movie; it is one of the best classics from Disney.
Some strange nether world happenings and not always keen on weird other world stuff.
For my money, this one is the better of the two and deserved to take home the Best Picture Oscar over "American Beauty".
Great movie all kids.  
But i dont expect they will last long.

That said, Candy Candido's floor-scraping vocals as 'Big Chief' are a pure hoot; and, should be taken in that spirit.
We enjoyed the "Disney View" presentation with scene-coordinated artwork replacing the black side curtains on our HD tv with the 4:3 proportioned movie.
These fanatically loyal fans are destined to be shocked and nearly traumatized when a Congressional investigation uncovers an ongoing hoax created and sustained by the network executives to rig the show in order to ensure that only the most physically attractive, charismatic contestants consistently win, thereby guaranteeing continued record-high ratings.
Great as the movie is, the picture restoration done here is a complete joke.
Like the cupholder/toy "basket" that is built in to the end of the tub.  Was easy to blow up.
Inc. is an instant classic that will entertain you, move you and make you have a wonderful time.
I would spend my nights in the bathtub pretending to be Ariel splashing up on the rock while watching Eric while singing.  
Hope this helps you find what you are looking for.
Voice talent includes Kathryn Beaumont (Alice), Ed Wynn (Mad Hatter), Verna Felton (Queen of Hearts), Sterling Holloway (Cheshire Cat), Richard Haydn (Caterpillar), and Bill Thompson (White Rabbit).As with most Disney Blu-ray and DVD releases, there is a huge number of bonus features.
