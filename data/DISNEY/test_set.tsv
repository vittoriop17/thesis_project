Even if you don't know much about cars or NASCARs, Cars is such fabulous entertainment their is no reason not to love it from beginning to end.  	Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale in particular the change to a happily ever after ending in the original she turns to foam at least thats what I remember that being said the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney never the less I highly recommend getting this disc hopefully Disney will come out with a BLURAY edition till then this isnt bad enjoy the story and artistry of the animators a little film grain doesnt really distract from ones enjoyment	0.4202558994293213

There also isn't any further aliasing or 3D-related anomalies to report, there aren't very many on-screen visuals or elements that fall victim to crosstalk (and those that do will only do so on 3D displays that are already prone to ghosting), and I didn't encounter much of anything that will give anyone pause.

It's a personal choice, I'm not condemning the film in any way and it still deserves the title of "classic" because of it's innovative style and incredible animation.	Though I wish Disney would retain the filmic look of their classic animated films by not scrubbing away the grain the way they do preferring instead they go for a more natural filmlike approach a la Studio Ghibli and their titles on Bluray I gotta admit that the way they do things in hidef still looks very impressive	0.4172203242778778

There have been many adaptations of the oldest known Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf, but interestingly enough, going into this film I was unaware that it was "loosely inspired" by the work and so failed to make the immediate connection.	There are so many films about teachers reaching tough students through inspired methods that they all start to run together and become this blur of mediocrity and ‘Dangerous Minds’ just doesn’t break the mold enough to be remembered for much of anything outside of the hit theme song ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ which is still one of the best movie songs penned in recent memory and this film is almost twenty years old  	0.3772006332874298

But what a legacy he left behindAnd how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie Little Shop of Horrors for which he isnt even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplayAnd this is the best of the lot because one day during the development of The Little Mermaid he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads  an archetypal analysis	0.4598710238933563

You cannot possibly expect the same voices to return as many decades has separated the two productions, so it's just plain lucky that Disney protégés embarked on taking the task to begin with, and this is far superior entertainment to most or any of today's cartoons in the first place.

Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale, in particular the change to a happily ever after ending (in the original she turns to foam, at least that's what I remember) that being said, the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards, not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney, never the less I highly recommend getting this disc, hopefully Disney will come out with a BLU-RAY edition, till then this isn't bad, enjoy the story and artistry of the animators, a little film grain doesn't really distract from ones enjoyment	Nolti and Short complement each other perfectly in this fantastic family film.	0.1534329354763031

It's perhaps unfair to judge Disney's "Little Mermaid" against Studio Ghibli's "Ponyo," especially considering the influence the former had on the latter, but there you have it: The world has moved on, and "Ponyo" is the better movie not only for its more charming animation style and creative story alterations, but for its change in attitude toward women and girls.	0.1833406686782837

I have been a fan of this movie ever since it came out so I was very excited to see that it was being rereleased	0.3883247971534729
To be fair, though, part of the bad has to do with the original fairy tale rather than merely this particular rendition thereof--and part of the bad, at least for me, has to do with something else external to the film which I'll get into in the review proper, and since it is external to the film, it isn't fair to blame this film, especially as I don't think that this film is responsible for the problem existing in the first place.	Love what Disney has done with the Little Mermaid tale in particular the change to a happily ever after ending in the original she turns to foam at least thats what I remember that being said the transfer to DVD is not up to Disneys high standards not really bad just not as good as one has come to expect from Disney never the less I highly recommend getting this disc hopefully Disney will come out with a BLURAY edition till then this isnt bad enjoy the story and artistry of the animators a little film grain doesnt really distract from ones enjoyment	0.5542534589767456

Disney has a thing about parents dying, and I forgot about that when we watched it with my 5 year old.	In the original "The Little Mermaid" the story is very depressing and negative and the prince was a jerk.	0.11626938730478287

Though I wish Disney would retain the filmic look of their classic animated films by not scrubbing away the grain the way they do, preferring instead they go for a more natural film-like approach a la Studio Ghibli and their titles on Blu-ray, I gotta admit that the way they do things in hi-def still looks very impressive.	But what a legacy he left behindAnd how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie Little Shop of Horrors for which he isnt even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplayAnd this is the best of the lot because one day during the development of The Little Mermaid he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads  an archetypal analysis	0.44961312413215637

But what a legacy he left behind!And how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him, with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks (and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie, Little Shop of Horrors, for which he isn't even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplay).And this is the best of the lot because, one day during the development of The Little Mermaid, he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads - an archetypal analysis.	Props to the people at Walt Disney Home Entertainment for not being completely Bluraycentric for those who still cling to standard DVD by including the newlyenhanced Inside Walts Story Meetings feature which replaces Patrick Stewart from the earlier version another reason to keep the old DVD set and adds about 26 additional minutes of expert on camera commentary and a constant stream of supporting visuals that fly by on the screen as the entire film plays	0.5016372799873352

But what a legacy he left behind!And how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him, with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks (and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie, Little Shop of Horrors, for which he isn't even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplay).And this is the best of the lot because, one day during the development of The Little Mermaid, he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads - an archetypal analysis.	There are so many films about teachers reaching tough students through inspired methods that they all start to run together and become this blur of mediocrity and ‘Dangerous Minds’ just doesn’t break the mold enough to be remembered for much of anything outside of the hit theme song ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ which is still one of the best movie songs penned in recent memory and this film is almost twenty years old  	0.47374868392944336

To be fair, though, part of the bad has to do with the original fairy tale rather than merely this particular rendition thereof--and part of the bad, at least for me, has to do with something else external to the film which I'll get into in the review proper, and since it is external to the film, it isn't fair to blame this film, especially as I don't think that this film is responsible for the problem existing in the first place.	But Disney eventually would issue a rerelease of the film in 1974But for todays current generation who have watched only the live action film of Alice in Wonderland now is the time to watch Alice in Wonderland as the film is receiving its 60th Anniversary Edition on Bluray and DVDBut before watching this film for those only familiar with the live action film think about Alice in Wonderland live action as a sequel to this animated film  	0.4792952537536621

Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.

Not being familiar with the book or the previous movie, this one is still pretty fun to watch.  	Though first I will say that on the whole the film is rather dull the one good thing about it is John Turturro who offers a brilliant vivid performance I will watch the movie when its on occasionally simply to listen to him hes a delight  	0.38489487767219543

the colors, the art, the monsters, the idea of capturing screams as energy - the scene with the conveyer belt-way of doors is mindboggling.

The only downside is that I will probably have to figure out how to jerry rig some kind of lace sling that I can use to secure him on my daughter's shoulder as she goes running and racing and bounding and chasing about the house.
