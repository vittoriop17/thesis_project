As mentioned, seeing the students take some sort of final exam or standardized test that showed how much Pfeiffer's character helped her students to graduate, would have been one of the most joyful, yet tear-jerking part of this movie.  	There are so many films about teachers reaching tough students through inspired methods that they all start to run together and become this blur of mediocrity and ‘Dangerous Minds’ just doesn’t break the mold enough to be remembered for much of anything outside of the hit theme song ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’ which is still one of the best movie songs penned in recent memory and this film is almost twenty years old  	0.34782904386520386

The choices made about what to leave out of the original story and what to expand don't measure up in hindsight as much as "Cinderella" or "Lady and the Tramp" do.

A more enlightened culture consciously decided to treat Native American's with more reverence particularly given the raw deal they been dealt since European's appeared on the shores of the new world.

I was hoping for action and exhilarating moments but no...all I got from the film was twelve characters, whom I have no idea who they are, and Antonio Banderas' two facial expressions: looking for words to express and feigning disbelief.	The Beast is an excellent character and the love story here is perhaps the most realistic Ive seen in a Disney animated fairy tale and Belle is a good character who is brave and to whom a promise means something and who tries to be polite even when she thinks very little of someone and not out of hypocrisy but simply out of not being a jerk  	0.4212810695171356

By now everyone has, or should have, seen Beauty and the Beast, so I won't comment on the film, however the transfer to Blu-Ray is stunning, not only the picture but the sound, the sound is far clearer and has more dynamic range than the DVD, the picture is among the best transfers Disney has done, which means flawless, enjoy.	I am giving the blu ray however only 4 stars cuz the transfer was far too painted over the movie didnt resemble its original color  on the blu ray it seems that they made everything way too vibrant and surreal there doesnt seem to be much of the original artwork intact  	0.4190368354320526

Instead, his producer, Stromboli, locks the new actor star in a bird cage, and Pinocchio becomes a miserable prisoner beholding to the big money bosses who profit from his work (a realistic comment on the reality of show business.)The entire movie is great entertainment, often touching, and filled with worthwhile and humane messages about the human condition, it's follies, and it's ultimate (at times) nobility.

If your budget only allows for 1 Disney 3D movie and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one, or the Lion King, I'd recommend this one (at least on the basis of the 3D--you would have to decide which story you like better.)What really throws me is that both movies were released at the same time in 3D, and the 3D quality is so different.	banderas has action down to a science this film says it all the critics didnt think that way but ive got a theory bout that one decided he didnt like the actor then all you need is a closed mind and the review lands the film in the toilet maybe even more it addresses  issues  and handles them so perhaps this is a couple shades above that  so go get a banana and see it you will discover that it is just that shade better than you think	0.51291823387146

I foresee not issues in the near or distant future at least no more than any normal 2 year old can muster  	0.4295874536037445
Many great lines that you will find yourself quoting in normal conversation with your friends.	If like me you find yourself wondering what makes the big guys in the entertainment industry so big youve come to the right review  	0.3711548149585724
There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.	He rescues his puppet maker father from a giant whale named MonstroThe movie ends happily with no departure from the happy old mans small home which celebrates the end of his loneliness and the arrival of human company in his life	0.3336957097053528
I would definitely recommend this for families with girls who will enjoy the play pieces even when the guessing cards lose their challenge and charm.	The velcro fastener holds tight.	0.006847838405519724
This is the second half of a two-part sequel to the brilliant original "Pirates of the Caribbean" film.	Suitable second half although first feature was made by Disneys liveliest pros this flick is on same par with Jungle Book 2 as a sequel	0.5361717343330383
The Spot:  Ex-employee of Stark Industries, Dr. Jonathan Ohn, invents a portable interdimensional technology that accidentally makes him the living embodiment of a portal.	This movie is about a boy Jimmy who lived his life in a bubble	0.38307416439056396
I don't particularly care for that much plastic on a vehicle that's supposed to be metal, but since we've owned our Red for almost two years, and it's still in excellent condition--except for a few minor surface scratches--I can't rate down for that.  	It has been a year since we bought most of them The paint is not chipped maybe a couple of scratches rolls well enough are made of substantial metals with little or no plastic parts and most importantly are well loved	0.3684864938259125
They did a great job on the 3D animation, almost as good as the IMAX underwater	The animation is superb	0.11684292554855347
Jiminy shows his talents here as being much more than Pinocchio's sidekick and conscience, and the live-action bits prove to be as delightful as the two animated stories showcased within.	The Beast is an excellent character and the love story here is perhaps the most realistic Ive seen in a Disney animated fairy tale and Belle is a good character who is brave and to whom a promise means something and who tries to be polite even when she thinks very little of someone and not out of hypocrisy but simply out of not being a jerk  	0.42659991979599
it just makes it a little unbelievable...breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit much.  	While you can notice some flickering of the outlines on characters, they're never distracting to me.	0.17023974657058716
This is a funny movie.	It's fun to hear Mac talk.  	0.3434135913848877
Growing up, "Peter Pan" and "Captain Hook" were classic characters that showcased good vs. evil.  	Great classic Disney	0.6000293493270874
we had all the videos from disney and wore them out.  	The scores are wonderful, spread out throughout the movie, and appropriately placed such that they do not distract from dialogue or action.  	0.12019160389900208
I inflated this Garanimals bath tub with an electric pump.	The audio /video quality is top notch however because hdtv is 16x9 disney started including black border art that matches the scene from the window so it looks widescreen not fullscreen and because the tile art looks like the blu ray i expected that at least the HD edition would include the border art so while everything else is great i can only give 4 out of 5 stars.	0.08200943470001221

There are rare exceptions though when a film is just okay and not, in my opinion, endowed with much "Disney Magic".	I dont even think it is close with the exception of Lady and the Tramp	0.39539358019828796
There are about 31 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer but many of them are quick.	The 3D does display very nice on my LG TV screen	0.4121529757976532

It is a good story with great characters, who despite being cars, you can sympathize and empathize with.	he's so obssessed with CG animation	0.07969573885202408

Meanwhile, a mysterious man named El Capitán busts the Beagle Boys out of jail in order for them to help him steal an awkward treasure map in Scrooge's possession.  	However, she's good with her toys -- and the smallest character in this set is Clover the bunny, who's about 1 1 /2" tall.  	0.11348811537027359
Being from the 60s, it really fits in with his persona of the time, in my opinion.	Its the equivalent of a late 60s musical in which things are just beginning to roll along when a character sits down and sings	0.25920388102531433
If your dolls don't have hands, you are good to go!  	There are some pretend scenarios, but princess lovers are sure to make up their own, including adding a few "rules" of their own.	0.22143012285232544
But considering how long it's probably been sitting in the plastic wrap, I'm surprised there's even a hint of a scent there at all, even if it's no longer strawberries.	I guess I understand why and I suppose I shouldnt be surprised but I think it wouldve been fun if the girls could have put some real perfume in these bottles	0.4024481773376465
It is delightful entertainment.	Super cute and fun	0.47285616397857666

I grew up watching this show since i was 5 when it came out in 1987 as it was one of my fave cartoons of that time with Real Ghostbusters, Transformers, Thundercats, GI Joe, He-Man, Rescue Rangers, She-Ra, Gummi Bears, Voltron and more.	This been my favorite cartoon since it came out back in 1989 or 1990	0.5313752293586731
Love the movie, cast........will enjoy watching it over and over.	Lots of cars made into cartoon characters which was fun to pick out all the different cars.	0.01736793853342533
The first season of "Gargoyles" was already impressive, but this is where things get epic.	As a matter of fact, the only names I remembered without looking up was Cliff Edwards, who plays the lovable (and sometimes feisty) Jiminy Cricket and Mel Blanc whose only contribution is a "hiccup" by Gideon, Foulfellow's sidekick.	0.18371573090553284
It becomes tedious very quickly and brings my overall rating down a star.	I would rate this 5 stars except the crown is ridiculously annoying to wear	0.275441974401474

The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.	OK I am all for political correctness however this film is not believable it has no story line and the acting is nonexistent	0.37356483936309814
I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn't like it so that is a plus.	I wish they had more like this that arent Disney princesswe got it as a gift and she doesnt even know who any of the characters are because Im not a huge Disney fan	0.4123261570930481
Now for my complanints - and I'll just start off by saying that these weren't bad enough for me to send the set back.	I appreciate that Disney gave time for Belle and the Beast to bond as it bothered me that many of the Disney princesses would fall in love right from the start even without knowing anything about the prince  	0.3956014811992645

Reviews for this film were positive enough to pass but not greatly, and it was not a giant hit at the box office.	I thought that as the Dodger MrWood needed to work on it quite a bit more but he wasnt convincing but not awful either	0.48557981848716736

That "Painting the Roses Red" song is just stupid, especially when the painters' cards are dragged away, they are singing stupidly about being beheaded!

The effects animation in Pinocchio is an entirely different matter, but it might well just be the greatest achievement of the whole film: from the fire that Pinocchio cooks up to make Monstro sneeze to the glow whenever the Blue Fairy appears, and from the shadows of Lampwick and Pinocchio to the water splashes made by Monstro himself (the water ripples are perhaps the most beautiful thing drawn by anyone in the Golden Age of Animation), the effects animation by itself represent a level of artistry that cannot be matched by today's computers.

There are little puzzle piece doors with different characters and then when it's your turn you pick a card that tells you what treasure to find (ex: pink shell, statue, anything purple, etc.) and you add that to the pile of things everyone is looking for, spin the spinner and that will tell you which puzzle piece door to lift (ex: Ariel or King Triton) and then you lift and look to see if there are any of those treasures under that door.

I love Disney and generally think they release home video products which are heads and shoulders above the competition but to add something in one release and then take it away in the next is insupportable.

I was especially careful with Prince James, since he didn't look too steady standing on that base with stick-like legs...but all the characters survived the de-packaging.  	The movie was interesting enough to sit through to the end but I never quite cared that much about any of the main characters	0.3727327585220337
When this set arrived I figured it would be about the same since I think it is from the same manufactuer, but since it had Rapunzel it was sure to be a hit with my daughter who falls asleep to "I Have a Dream" every night. .

I soon lost count of how many times the character's lives were seemingly in danger, whether they were falling from high distances, or hanging on for dear life to prevent the former.

I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film; the poor fellow must have been jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.	I was dubious of seeing this movie when it came out because Disney movies had grown to have politically correct and sterile or formulaic plots particularly in the late 1990s	0.3206952214241028
