In fact the film, like most Disney animated pieces, earns the G-rating and manages to pack some pretty intense sequences into the generally restrictive criteria.  	To be short the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994s The Lion King which does have a lot of computer work on it but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking and perhaps Miyazakis 1997 Princess Mononoke in fact perhaps even much of the Ghibli work almost all of which is handdrawn with very little computer workSome of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet	0.4097318649291992

And again, even with regard to the plot, it is not heavy-handed here, and it wasn't until now, so many years later, that it occurred to me that the plot was really an "anti-fairy tale", something that I've grown to hate.

Nemo directly and deliberately disobeys his father and gets kidnapped as a result; Marlon overcomes many a ''hardship'' along the way and ''grows'' into a ''better'' father figure upon his reunion with his son; but first, we needed two fake outs in which the film expects us to believe that Nemo's either dead or dying, the second one followng an arbitrary climax.	0.1272667795419693

It would be really embarrassing to walk into a room where your five year olds are discussing the ramifications on world peace, stability, and the food supply, from a marriage between a land based Kingdom and a Sea-God dynasty, if all  you can say is "Now children, it's only a movie!".	With that being said if one was to ask me how I rank Alice in Wonderland I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline while a good and fun family film at times because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative its not a film that I can easily compare to a Snow White Pinocchio or Dumbo  	0.3189026415348053

Nemo directly and deliberately disobeys his father and gets kidnapped as a result; Marlon overcomes many a ''hardship'' along the way and ''grows'' into a ''better'' father figure upon his reunion with his son; but first, we needed two fake outs in which the film expects us to believe that Nemo's either dead or dying, the second one followng an arbitrary climax.	You got the stupid premise of a fish looking for his son and having to travel a long way to find him and the rest is way to predictable  even if we never made it through to the end	0.48730233311653137

The characters are still the same people, with the main gang still having their tendency to get into trouble (specifically TJ), and while many of the antagonists from the show work with the other characters, they still have the same personality traits and quirks (ie: The Ashleys).My main complaint with the movie is no fault of the movie itself, but rather my own opinion.	Only a tiny number of characters made after their time or even after this film have come anywhere close to equaling the marvelous achievements of the cast of characters animated and ACTED which is what character animation is essentially with such fussy detail	0.4835808575153351

However, while it is shrinkwrapped and unopened, there was no outer artwork which is standard in Disney dvds.	I give the movie and the picture and sound 5 starsHowever in an age where we have bluray which can hold the info of 10 dvds it is sad to say that Disney did not utilize this to add on any bonus features other than a deleted alternate opening which can be found on the Ultimate Collectors Edition DVD which was released in 2000  	0.2743229269981384

You cannot possibly expect the same voices to return as many decades has separated the two productions, so it's just plain lucky that Disney protégés embarked on taking the task to begin with, and this is far superior entertainment to most or any of today's cartoons in the first place.	While the laughs arent huge they are there and while you wont be laughing every time you watch it assuming that you watch it more than once the first time will deliver a slew of mildly entertaining takes on rather uninspired gags yes weve seen almost all of these gags before done better I might add and yet there is something about Sorority Boys that makes it enjoyable  	0.42867451906204224

The film degenerates into icky sexual innuendo, with the birdies billing and cooing in a sickening manner, the females "coming on" aggressively to the males (the opposite of what actually occurs), ** and mammals actually blushing over their entire bodies -- ignoring Mark Twain's famous observation.	Indeed this film and the lecture stand at the opposite end of the spectrum to the recently released and hugely overrated Frozen which no matter how beautifully made and wonderful visually is structurally flawed dated sexist and unpleasant in its core	0.43789008259773254
We get it, Elizabeth and Jack have a little sexual tension.	But the character development and underlying tension are the same	0.08933734893798828

You can read the other potty seat reviews I've written - we haven't had much luck with some fancier, more expensive potty seats - this was purchased as a spur of the moment, I can't stand the horrible munchkin deluxe seat, that replaced the awful summer infant three in one, which in retrospect was better than the munchkin product - but still useless.

Perhaps most distinctively, Alice distinguishes herself from other cartoon heroines in that she seems to have a raging obsession with formality, dignity and politeness, which I still find one of the most charming traits any protagonist could possibly have.

Using a closet door portal system, monsters are able to access the bedrooms of children to sneak in scare the ba-jesus out of them for "scare power".	I was nervous about whether the monsters would scare her but this issue is handled very tactfully and in my opinion there are only 2 times when monsters do something scary roar and it is either immediately followed by something silly that makes the monster look ridiculous or contrition on the part of the monster	0.40115877985954285

The fact that this film made so much money from the toys is why "Cars" was the first Pixar film other than "Toy Story" to give a sequel, and guess what; " Cars 2" became Pixar's least critically successful film.

The original Alice in Wonderland books were brilliantly-disguised pieces of social and political sattire, with the behaviors of the various characters poking fun at a number of trends which existed at the time, and much the same thing can be found here.	The characters are still the same people with the main gang still having their tendency to get into trouble specifically TJ and while many of the antagonists from the show work with the other characters they still have the same personality traits and quirks ie The AshleysMy main complaint with the movie is no fault of the movie itself but rather my own opinion	0.41787657141685486

Only the usually reliable James Donald who specialised in playing the understated voice of reason in tales of obsession like Bridge on the River Kwai is a bit more awkward playing outside his comfort zone as the stern occasionally belligerent uncle but its more a performance that occasionally wavers in the wrong direction before righting itself than one that hurts the picture	0.38039320707321167

The first act of Phase One can't be blamed on ABC portraying the show wrongly (though they did make their promo for this episode feature the first act almost exclusively as I recall), that one is on the producers and, as epic and important an episode as it it, they held it back a bit in my mind and turned a lot of potential new fans of the show off with that stunt and by post-Super Bowl standards the ratings for this episode were very poor.

I haven't sat through the entirety of Brother Bear 2 (as a rule, I dislike all of the cash-in sequels) but did want to check out the picture quality, and I have to say that it is gorgeous as well.

Other gems include an impromptu karaoke session to the Spice Girls' If you Wanna Be My Lover and the Bee Gees Stayin' Alive as character motivation (heck even the credit roll begins with a pretty funny rendition of Elton John's Don't go Breaking My Heart).Living legend Hans Zimmer is responsible for the film's scoring so soaring highs, creepy lows and perfectly appropriate mood settings are a given.	This video is a very important part of my little one's day!	0.17531967163085938
even though the main characters are superficial and one dimensional, they are well done and feel very human, which is essential for a film mostly about dogs.this film is still a lot of fun today as it was in the 60's and 70's and it's definitely a must for any doggie/Disney lover.	To be short the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994s The Lion King which does have a lot of computer work on it but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking and perhaps Miyazakis 1997 Princess Mononoke in fact perhaps even much of the Ghibli work almost all of which is handdrawn with very little computer workSome of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet	0.4624788761138916

Good for rollplaying and not difficult if she wants to take them to bed either.

My only benefit derived from that is to see that in fact it is always exactly the same, except for Kermit's announcing the special guest star, and Gonzo's running gag with the gong.	The first act of Phase One cant be blamed on ABC portraying the show wrongly though they did make their promo for this episode feature the first act almost exclusively as I recall that one is on the producers and as epic and important an episode as it it they held it back a bit in my mind and turned a lot of potential new fans of the show off with that stunt and by postSuper Bowl standards the ratings for this episode were very poor	0.4014495015144348
This film isn't guaranteed to effect most people in the same way it did me, because most people dont have that first hand experience with what the film more or less deals with, and also in an innocent way, not like in a dark foreign art house film that'd make the thing into a very dark and disturbing endeavor, here, to me and my experiences, Rushmore couldn't BE anymore realistic.	All pretty visuals in a film this nasty and this hateful can do is ultimately invite others to sit back and embrace the film for all it has to offer Carefully calculated sentimentality trite jokes and unlikable characters	0.4316231906414032

With that being said, if one was to ask me how I rank "Alice in Wonderland", I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline, while a good and fun family film at times, because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative, it's not a film that I can easily compare to a "Snow White", "Pinocchio" or "Dumbo".

With that being said, if one was to ask me how I rank "Alice in Wonderland", I would give high marks for animation but as for storyline, while a good and fun family film at times, because Walt Disney was going for a visual film with music than a film with a tight narrative, it's not a film that I can easily compare to a "Snow White", "Pinocchio" or "Dumbo".
