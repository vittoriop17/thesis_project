also there are no extra features I'm really annoyed at the general quality of this DVDNormally I'd say avoid this disk set, but sadly this may be the only way to watch this now classic cartoon series because this DVD set is becoming slightly rare and since it no longer airs on TV you may still want to consider buying it anyway because once DVD sales slowdown you may not be able to get your hands on another copy so don't rule out buying it while supplies last, just don't expect more then a few fun eps & a bit of childhood nostalgia because if you expect more then that you'll be as disappointed as I am.	also if you make this purchase for the 3D edition you get the standards that the other versions come with 2D Bluray and dvd also you get for FREE a digital copy which as of this writing costs 20 here on amazon also you get a digital music download which honestly wasnt that great since I still have the original CD release from way back when	0.5601040720939636

Mary Pickford was to play a live Alice for Disney, along with Ginger Rogers--and even Margaret O'Brien, whose mother turned it down because of the price offered (a fact she recently told talk show host Stu Shostak on a recent shokusradio.com broadcast).By the time "Alice" was underway as an all-animated feature, the studio was still hurting from WWII losses, the 1950 release "Cinderella" had helped things considerably and high hopes were dashed when "Alice" initially underperformed at the box office.

Cons, a difficult to believe romance between stars I found irritating (it seemed like they were going for a Han Solo kinda thing with Gould's character, but it just wasn't working for me, nothing against him), a story that felt a little anticlimactic and had some holes, and an absolutely horrendous theme song.

I make no accusations against anyone who made this film because I don't know, but the generic plot here (which I've seen oh so many times since) strikes me as having been made by people who don't understand fairy tales and don't want to bother trying--who, to be blunt, are prejudiced against real fairy tales.

Fish slowly swim right out of the screen, reefs stretch far into the watery distance, aquarium rocks and decorations provide a sense of boxed-in space and suitably cramped scope, sharks and sea turtles float in and out of the foreground, jellyfish clump believably to form a net of deadly obstacles, and the movie looks as if it were designed from the ground-up with a 3D presentation in mind.

This movie captures the essence of the 1950's quiz show scandals, at least as far as the show "21" - there were other lesser-known fixed quiz shows and scandals of the era, but this was by far the most interesting, because of the personalities involved.

And while the Magic Code will not work in your US Disney rewards account, sadly, the bottom line is there is no need for you to wait for Disney to decide that Americans are finally ready for the honor and blessings of these wonderful films (I include Aladdin in this sarcasm) to be released domestically on Blu Ray.  	also there are no extra features Im really annoyed at the general quality of this DVDNormally Id say avoid this disk set but sadly this may be the only way to watch this now classic cartoon series because this DVD set is becoming slightly rare and since it no longer airs on TV you may still want to consider buying it anyway because once DVD sales slowdown you may not be able to get your hands on another copy so dont rule out buying it while supplies last just dont expect more then a few fun eps  a bit of childhood nostalgia because if you expect more then that youll be as disappointed as I am	0.4525724947452545

It's a cluttered muddle that simply does not capture the essence of the Lewis Carroll books, mainly because Carroll's subtle humor is buried under an avalanche of Disney kitsch, but also because Disney failed to capture the willful, prickly spirit of the Alice character... or indeed, to give her any personality at all.

I will always miss the more rambunctious side of Pinocchio that Walt Disney chooses to ignore, and that decision makes this movie a little weaker than it could have been.

Any problems that I might have with this film stem entirely from its lack of any clear message or moral, and that's merely a personal bias of mine.

In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.	If you liked this movie then watch the sequel as you can see this and the sequel as one story due to what happens in the second story since it feels more like a continuation to this one rather than just a sequel	0.5324620604515076

also there are no extra features I'm really annoyed at the general quality of this DVDNormally I'd say avoid this disk set, but sadly this may be the only way to watch this now classic cartoon series because this DVD set is becoming slightly rare and since it no longer airs on TV you may still want to consider buying it anyway because once DVD sales slowdown you may not be able to get your hands on another copy so don't rule out buying it while supplies last, just don't expect more then a few fun eps & a bit of childhood nostalgia because if you expect more then that you'll be as disappointed as I am.	If the other discs are exactly the same as the previous release then you may as well get this because it is a topnotch release but if you already have the original Diamond Edition dont bother with this unless youre set up with 3D and dont mind to doubledip for a 2D animated movie which Im sure makes up about 0000005 of the entire globes population	0.5176634192466736

The only animated films that could quite honestly compete visually with it are the same year's Fantasia (which had some very similar artistry, particularly during "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" sequence) and 1959's Sleeping Beauty (the perfect example of a moving tapestry).To make animated films of similar feeling and quality today, most animators prominently use computers, which do give a rich quality yes, but the effect is not the same.
