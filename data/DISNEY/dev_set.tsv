You can read the other potty seat reviews I've written - we haven't had much luck with some fancier, more expensive potty seats - this was purchased as a spur of the moment, I can't stand the horrible munchkin deluxe seat, that replaced the awful summer infant three in one, which in retrospect was better than the munchkin product - but still useless.

To be short the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994s The Lion King which does have a lot of computer work on it but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking and perhaps Miyazakis 1997 Princess Mononoke in fact perhaps even much of the Ghibli work almost all of which is handdrawn with very little computer workSome of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet	0.4097318649291992

It's got several musical cartoons on it which are fairly short and great for my primary aged students.  	To be short the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994s The Lion King which does have a lot of computer work on it but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking and perhaps Miyazakis 1997 Princess Mononoke in fact perhaps even much of the Ghibli work almost all of which is handdrawn with very little computer workSome of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet	0.4169299304485321
