The problem is that there isn’t anything really special here, and the film doesn’t try to do anything but repeat the tried and true formula of giving the teacher a backbone and heart that others didn’t have and so the film winds up feeling very generic.

For many of them, it was their first big assignment: Pinocchio himself was done mostly by Milt Kahl, with some contributions done by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston; Jiminy Cricket was handled by Ward Kimball, and this assignment was the only thing that kept him at the Disney Studios after two of his scenes originally planned for Snow White were discarded; Art Babbitt, in one of his last Disney projects, animated Geppetto, whom the animator thought to be his greatest accomplishment;	Nick Nolte and Martin Short each play their role beautifully, but the sweetness of the little girl touches the heart...  	0.15744514763355255

The two animated stories(Ariel and Jasmine) are just episodes from the 1995 Little Mermaid and 1993 Aladdin TV series, but that did little to cheapen the quality of this DVD.	This has only a couple of episodes but I am very pleased with this	0.4561433792114258

The humor is actually a little weak, especially when compared to the more risqué overtones made famous by prime competition DreamWorks.

But needless to say, "Bambi" has come an instant classic in Walt Disney's line of animated films ("Bambi" is the fifth film from Walt Disney) and it also paved the way for the animation industry as the film would lead to the hiring of Disney's first female animator, the film would utilize multiplane camera technology, would feature an impressionist style courtesy of artist Tyrus "Ty" Wong and his artwork of the forests would be groundbreaking for its time and an inspiration for future artists.

The only animated films that could quite honestly compete visually with it are the same year's Fantasia (which had some very similar artistry, particularly during "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" sequence) and 1959's Sleeping Beauty (the perfect example of a moving tapestry).To make animated films of similar feeling and quality today, most animators prominently use computers, which do give a rich quality yes, but the effect is not the same.

It still has his quirky style and music usage, but the characters are actually relatable and the plot is relatively straightforward.	I feel like the love story formula they used in the show is a bit over used and got a little annoyed with the constant pratfalls that the lead character is forced to endure but I love the bacholorette party and getting to hear the singing of both Julie Andrews and Raven cant remember her real nameOh and the closet is practically a character in its own right	0.4293201267719269

Even if you don't believe in Catholic Christianity or patriarchy, as I do, I would hope that an open mind and an open heart would recognize that this kind of plot line depends upon people already being familiar with "the way things are", in order to question the wisdom of their being that way, and so this kind of story depends upon the very thing it's against, in order to make sense.  	Children may relate to her confusion at seeing so many strange things in the world and her sense of wonder when she encounters them but I think it would be too much to suggest that there is any child quite like her	0.3941386044025421

An Arab is outcast from his country for having an affair with the wife of a nobleman.

The juxtaposition of the two couples was very poignant and more successful than in a similar movie, the second of the Mummy movies by SommerThe Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition)with Brandon Frasier and Rachel Weisz playing the "good couple", where a similar pair of couples highlights the difference between mere passion and true devotion.

I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.4710771441459656

I expected something incredible and to tell you the truth, I was pretty much expecting better picture quality in HD and lossless audio quality with the same special features and maybe a new audio commentary and possibly a retrospective featurette, but Disney has surpassed my expectations by giving us way more than what we would have expected for this film and I'm impressed and also very grateful.	The animation for Peter Pan still holds up to this day and with this Bluray release Im quite pleased with the Diamond Edition as it continues to carry the quality that Disney has done previously with their Walt Disney Animated Classics series on Bluray and really giving fans what they want in terms of pristine picture quality crisp lossless audio and a plethora of special features	0.5604963302612305

Fish slowly swim right out of the screen, reefs stretch far into the watery distance, aquarium rocks and decorations provide a sense of boxed-in space and suitably cramped scope, sharks and sea turtles float in and out of the foreground, jellyfish clump believably to form a net of deadly obstacles, and the movie looks as if it were designed from the ground-up with a 3D presentation in mind.	0.07742898166179657

My only complaints -- 1. too many small "filler" pieces that pad the piece count on the box front that you can't use to "build" with and I don't care for stickers -- just include pre "painted" pieces already (example -- the "pies" are pre-decorated parts.	The included brick picker is nice to have to get some of the previously mentioned little parts off of things like base plates	0.44567418098449707
She is very happy with it.	The animation is very well done in this film, as it's Oscar will attest to, and the backgrounds are rendered with a level of detail Disney films have lacked in recent years.	0.11289889365434647

Overall, I am happy I made the purchase because I now have memories of her dancing around singing Christmas songs.....eventually, I may snap the dvd in half though :)	Music would be the focus of the film (the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film) and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrol's books (this of course would anger British film and literary critics).But unfortunately, the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be re-released theatrically, "Alice in Wonderland" was not re-released during Walt Disney's lifetime but only on television.  	0.13822996616363525

One French admiral commanding a squadron of real warships, including a ship of the line, at first correctly assumed that a convoy of East Indiamen which he had intercepted was running this particular bluff, pressed his attack up to the point when his battleship and frigates and the East Indiamen had exchanged broadsides for 45 minutes - and then changed his mind as English  cannonballs continued slamming into his ships.	The East India Company merchant vessels masquerading as RN battleships carried out perfectly the difficult manouver of tacking in sequence towards the enemy and when they opened fire mounted enough guns had crews who knew how to use them and landed enough hits on the French warships that their admiral jumped to the false conclusion that he had after all accidentally attacked a larger Royal Navy force and ordered a withdrawal	0.48538938164711
