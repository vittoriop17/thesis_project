When I saw the play in Vienna nobody danced to this beautiful waltz melody, which I found missed a wonderful opportunity; in this edition's version there is more than enough dancing during the musical number, but the pictures and gags implemented are not quite as original as the rest, less classical and more "childlike" - the animation not so detailed, the colours more faded and the whole scene seems to address itself more to the children than to all viewers.	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.523560106754303

While "Bambi" would become an instant classic for Disney throughout the last 70-years, back in 1942, the film still faced problems due to World War II and would also lose money in the box office, but it would regain its income in 1947 and would also receive the ire from hunters who felt the film was harsh towards them.	Its important for people to know that prior to Alice in Wonderland  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II also where the first animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were a financial success the second film Pinocchio was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release wouldnt happen because of the war  	0.49040254950523376

The effects animation in Pinocchio is an entirely different matter, but it might well just be the greatest achievement of the whole film: from the fire that Pinocchio cooks up to make Monstro sneeze to the glow whenever the Blue Fairy appears, and from the shadows of Lampwick and Pinocchio to the water splashes made by Monstro himself (the water ripples are perhaps the most beautiful thing drawn by anyone in the Golden Age of Animation), the effects animation by itself represent a level of artistry that cannot be matched by today's computers.	To be short the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994s The Lion King which does have a lot of computer work on it but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking and perhaps Miyazakis 1997 Princess Mononoke in fact perhaps even much of the Ghibli work almost all of which is handdrawn with very little computer workSome of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet	0.4677215814590454

When I saw the play in Vienna nobody danced to this beautiful waltz melody, which I found missed a wonderful opportunity; in this edition's version there is more than enough dancing during the musical number, but the pictures and gags implemented are not quite as original as the rest, less classical and more "childlike" - the animation not so detailed, the colours more faded and the whole scene seems to address itself more to the children than to all viewers.	The delight continued through the film which had the best original songs since Dumbo and ushered in a new style for Disney in which the songs werent just animated they moved the story forward Broadwaylike in the manner of Rodgers and Hammerstein hence the subsequent staged adaptations of this and other animated features  	0.5376322269439697

Walt Disney first thought about adapting Carroll's book into a full-length movie back in 1923 when he was a 21-year-old filmmaker trying to make a name for himself.	The Boy Who Wouldnt Grow Up would be featured in a stage play in 1904 to be followed by a novel titled Peter and Wendy in 1911For a  young Walt Disney Peter Pan was one of Disneys favorite stories growing up and back in 1935 he originally intended for Peter Pan to be the second Disney animated film after Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  	0.5027116537094116

The film's gentle advocacy of low impact style can also be interpreted as an advocacy of: (1) Ensuring that one is adequately prepared for accomplishing any particular task or goal, being self-sufficient, and not having to rely on other people as a safety net; (2) Individualism and the willingness to accept responsibility for one's own actions.  	a testament to how powerful the LDS church is in defining roles and no allowance for questioning ones faith personal experience with LDS missionaries amazes and inspires but have great sympathy for impressionable youth who are not even permitted to be present with anyone alone outside the church makes you think fear is such a motivating factor	0.4790647029876709

So here is a girl who rebels against her father to get her own stubborn way and in the end seems to be rewarded for it, plus there is a scene of animated nudity in this film as she transforms from mermaid to human, the sea witch is just too dispicable for my children to watch... by far one of the worst disney movies EVER.	Not 20 minutes into the film our heroine makes a very hard act of self sacrifice to save her father as opposed to fathers helping their daughters in other films if they are there at all and not long after that gets in trouble for her curiosity rather than her beauty which is usually what gets princesses into troubleHer relationship with the Beast doesnt exactly click from the get go	0.5921704769134521
Just like Zurg from the movie.  	Looks exactly like Woody from the movies  	0.5681869387626648
In the later books Michael and Mia did break up for a couple of years and it caused Mia to have so much emotional stress that she had to go into therapy, I don't think that the way that Anne's Mia took the break up was all that realistic to Mia).	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.46895211935043335

I guarantee you, however, nothing about this story is creepy, and by the end of it, you'll have totally forgotten they are technically monsters.	I was nervous about whether the monsters would scare her but this issue is handled very tactfully and in my opinion there are only 2 times when monsters do something scary roar and it is either immediately followed by something silly that makes the monster look ridiculous or contrition on the part of the monster	0.2564602494239807
The last scene, with a monster coming out of the closet not to scare a child but to greet her, is one of the sweetest moments in CGI history.	Using a closet door portal system monsters are able to access the bedrooms of children to sneak in scare the bajesus out of them for scare power	0.5570314526557922

Rather, I went into this project naive... ignorant of the details of the story of Alice in Wonderland... ignorant of the poems within the story, and certainly ignorant of the comings and goings in Lewis Carroll's life that set up the circumstances allowing him to imagine the story of Alice in Wonderland (originally entitled "Alice's Adventures Underground", by the way).Watching that 1951 Disney rendition of AIW was a remarkable experience.	This is a story about Mater scaring the town with little tricks so he is told a story about the infamous Ghost Light which he then appears to experience after left alone	0.4190398156642914

apart from imaginative play, I'm pretty neutral about it, since it's based on a TV show, and my daughter's not able to fully voice her stories about them...yet.

It's important for people to know that prior to "Alice in Wonderland",  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II, also where the first animated film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" were a financial success, the second film "Pinocchio" was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release, wouldn't happen because of the war.  	In fact Walt Disney was heavily in debt from the 30s and 40s that in 1950 everything was put on the line with the film Cinderella and fortunately the film was financially successful and eventually gave Disney the freedom it needed to create more animated films	0.5368109941482544

To be short, the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994's The Lion King (which does have a lot of computer work on it, but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking) and perhaps Miyazaki's 1997 Princess Mononoke (in fact, perhaps even much of the Ghibli work, almost all of which is hand-drawn with very little computer work).Some of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film, specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet.

Where Andersen uses voicelessness to tell a cautionary tale about being true to yourself, to warn against changing for a fickle man, Disney uses voicelessness to tell us that makeovers work (at least until sea witches interfere), and HAPPY ENDINGS DO COME TRUE.

Pinocchio (1940 Disney) starring Dickie Jones, Cliff Edwards, Walter Catlett, and Frankie Darro (voiceover talent for major cartoon characters in the movie) is a satisfying, simple, well done movie set in the Swiss Italian mountains of northern Italy, and is based on an Italian folk tale by "Collodi."	Music would be the focus of the film the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrols books this of course would anger British film and literary criticsBut unfortunately the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be rereleased theatrically Alice in Wonderland was not rereleased during Walt Disneys lifetime but only on television  	0.4191441237926483
There's enough in it that's factually correct to give an overview of what turned out to be rigging of show outcomes on a grand scale.

In fact, Walt Disney was heavily in debt from the '30s and '40s that in 1950, everything was put on the line with the film "Cinderella" and fortunately, the film was financially successful and eventually gave Disney the freedom it needed to create more animated films.	Its important for people to know that prior to Alice in Wonderland  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II also where the first animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs were a financial success the second film Pinocchio was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release wouldnt happen because of the war  	0.6075302958488464

Though her parents are very sensitive to racism and this story is filled with it around Native Americans, they do not feel it is obvious enough to effect their daughters.	Not 20 minutes into the film our heroine makes a very hard act of self sacrifice to save her father as opposed to fathers helping their daughters in other films if they are there at all and not long after that gets in trouble for her curiosity rather than her beauty which is usually what gets princesses into troubleHer relationship with the Beast doesnt exactly click from the get go	0.36904895305633545

I agree with the general consensus that Disney did a spectacular job transferring this classic into the 3D format but where was the much ballyhooed additional sequence Human Again that added so much to the original blu ray release last year?Are we just supposed to forget that 8 minutes of music and animation were added to the overall experience in 2D?  	When I saw the play in Vienna nobody danced to this beautiful waltz melody which I found missed a wonderful opportunity in this editions version there is more than enough dancing during the musical number but the pictures and gags implemented are not quite as original as the rest less classical and more childlike  the animation not so detailed the colours more faded and the whole scene seems to address itself more to the children than to all viewers	0.4524340331554413

So imagine how eager Disneyphiles were for the new release, firmly believing they'll nail it this time and that the Diamond Edition would look more like the 1991 film than the 2002 one.	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.41654327511787415

The effects animation in Pinocchio is an entirely different matter, but it might well just be the greatest achievement of the whole film: from the fire that Pinocchio cooks up to make Monstro sneeze to the glow whenever the Blue Fairy appears, and from the shadows of Lampwick and Pinocchio to the water splashes made by Monstro himself (the water ripples are perhaps the most beautiful thing drawn by anyone in the Golden Age of Animation), the effects animation by itself represent a level of artistry that cannot be matched by today's computers.	breathtaking animation and a different style in music score with Phil Collins performing the majoirty of it Tarzan is an adventure that seems perfect for a Disney animated film	0.49033111333847046

The only shame is that the studio brought Andersen's original ending--which in the final analysis IS a happy ending--crashing to earth, much the same as they did with "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" segment in "Fantasia 2000."

In fact, Walt Disney was heavily in debt from the '30s and '40s that in 1950, everything was put on the line with the film "Cinderella" and fortunately, the film was financially successful and eventually gave Disney the freedom it needed to create more animated films.	It was Walt Disneys second feature length cartoon following the epic success of Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs 1937 Disney which made more money than any in movie history up to that time and this was the Golden Age Of Big Studio Hollywood and which lit the fire under the MGM studios to create The Wizard Of Oz 1939 MGM starring Judy Garland to cash in on the same unexpected and spectacular success Disneys Snow White movie had achieved	0.6258280873298645

I agree with the general consensus that Disney did a spectacular job transferring this classic into the 3D format but where was the much ballyhooed additional sequence Human Again that added so much to the original blu ray release last year?Are we just supposed to forget that 8 minutes of music and animation were added to the overall experience in 2D?  	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.49081745743751526
I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.	As the first ever animated film to be nominated for Best Picture the movie itself doesnt really need me to say how great it is	0.4084460735321045

The animation in this film is what we've come to expect from Disney and the story is intriguing, but I guess because I had never seen this film it didn't have the same effect as other Disney's films I grew up with.	Music would be the focus of the film the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrols books this of course would anger British film and literary criticsBut unfortunately the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be rereleased theatrically Alice in Wonderland was not rereleased during Walt Disneys lifetime but only on television  	0.6354480385780334

She still likes playing with the plastic jewelry, but isn't interested in playing the actual game anymore.	To be short, the only animated films after 1959 that could compete with Pinocchio and Sleeping Beauty are 1994's The Lion King (which does have a lot of computer work on it, but the level of artistry brought to the African savannah is absolutely breathtaking) and perhaps Miyazaki's 1997 Princess Mononoke (in fact, perhaps even much of the Ghibli work, almost all of which is hand-drawn with very little computer work).Some of the most marvelous animation set pieces in Pinocchio come quite early in the film, specifically on the shots where Geppetto is putting the final features on his little wooden puppet.	0.29514962434768677

It's important for people to know that prior to "Alice in Wonderland",  Walt Disney and its studios were heavily affected because of World War II, also where the first animated film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" were a financial success, the second film "Pinocchio" was not and other films that would recoup money through worldwide release, wouldn't happen because of the war.  	Music would be the focus of the film the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrols books this of course would anger British film and literary criticsBut unfortunately the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be rereleased theatrically Alice in Wonderland was not rereleased during Walt Disneys lifetime but only on television  	0.5778509974479675

He attempted to make a live-action version with Mary Pickford in 1933 while affiliated with United Artists though its more than obvious that it was not commercially viable firstly because of Paramount's adaption secondly has to with that its not fathomable for that type of adaption to have the same impact as Snow White which shaped the family film market as we know it today, contrary to what people might have previously thought however is that Disney's films did have psychological undertones not akin to what would be seen in a children's movie.	0.18087565898895264

And furthermore,  it was either Three Men and a Baby or Police Academy that had the dubious honor of making Steve Guttenberg a star (so much for it being the Stonecutters).Then again, who's keeping track?I prefer the sequel for no other reason than a five year old is more fun than a bald, gender-ambiguous, personality-ambiguous baby.  	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.4418826401233673

Call me biased but not only is the artwork magnificent, everything about it... from the animation, it's character design, the cast (the voice actors were magnificent and how they used the young voice actor's accidental pauses during the recording and actually using it in the film was brilliant!), its music and the storyline, everything works in harmony.  	this amazingAlas my love for the rich animation the boisterous musical numbers Be Our Guest is one of the best Disney songs ever the impassioned performances they may merely be voice actors but the emotional relevance is there in every syllable and the soulful understanding of the material goes unmatched really	0.4995266795158386

The world consists entirely of personified animals and casting Don Knotts as the jittery turkey mayor, Wallace Shawn as the canine school principle and the duo of Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara as the alien couple proves that Disney's knack for selecting appropriate vocal talent was never in jeopardy.

The Prince was a beast long before the crone placed him under her monstrous spell (why she placed the Prince's entourage and household servants under a similar spell seems a bit unclear to me; perhaps their unquestioning devotion to him deserved punishment as well).  	The reason why the beloved is a prince even if only in disguise in traditional fairy tales is because he has the status to be able to defeat the oppressor of his beloved where she does not and so he rescues her from her predicamentand the princes love and marriage to him are gifts not something the female protagonist earned who can earn something like that  	0.4299565553665161
This is not a review of the Blu-ray version of this picture;  I have what is called the Masterpiece Edition which was beautifully processed and done in the films's original aspect ratio or close to it.

The reason why the beloved is a prince (even if only in disguise) in traditional fairy tales is because he has the status to be able to defeat the oppressor of his beloved where she does not, and so he rescues her from her predicament--and the prince's love and marriage to him are gifts, not something the female protagonist earned (who can "earn" something like that?).  	Not 20 minutes into the film our heroine makes a very hard act of self sacrifice to save her father as opposed to fathers helping their daughters in other films if they are there at all and not long after that gets in trouble for her curiosity rather than her beauty which is usually what gets princesses into troubleHer relationship with the Beast doesnt exactly click from the get go	0.5296581387519836

The world consists entirely of personified animals and casting Don Knotts as the jittery turkey mayor, Wallace Shawn as the canine school principle and the duo of Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara as the alien couple proves that Disney's knack for selecting appropriate vocal talent was never in jeopardy.

that the film was based upon, and wasn't disappointed with that, either - even though the producers of the film took some differing "tracks" with the story line within the book - it still came out a superb film!!	Music would be the focus of the film the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrols books this of course would anger British film and literary criticsBut unfortunately the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be rereleased theatrically Alice in Wonderland was not rereleased during Walt Disneys lifetime but only on television  	0.5170468091964722

The reason why the beloved is a prince (even if only in disguise) in traditional fairy tales is because he has the status to be able to defeat the oppressor of his beloved where she does not, and so he rescues her from her predicament--and the prince's love and marriage to him are gifts, not something the female protagonist earned (who can "earn" something like that?).

Only Mulan shows a degree of moral fortitude similar to Belle when she, too, saves her incapacitated father's life by taking his place (but, as pointed out in another Amazon review, who remembers any of the songs in Mulan?).So, given that you simply MUST buy this film, the question becomes Blu-ray or DVD-only?

Disney has to be congratulated for largely sticking with the original, and not trying to sentimentalize the books.
