What we have here basically is a layered parody of blue-collar life as the catalyst to deliver an inversed look at the myths all kids can relate with.

The story begins in the early 1900s London, when Wendy, John and Michael Darling's father is exasperated because the boys are being affected by Wendy's stories about Peter Pan, who has become their hero.

But needless to say, "Bambi" has come an instant classic in Walt Disney's line of animated films ("Bambi" is the fifth film from Walt Disney) and it also paved the way for the animation industry as the film would lead to the hiring of Disney's first female animator, the film would utilize multiplane camera technology, would feature an impressionist style courtesy of artist Tyrus "Ty" Wong and his artwork of the forests would be groundbreaking for its time and an inspiration for future artists.

Even if you don't believe in Catholic Christianity or patriarchy, as I do, I would hope that an open mind and an open heart would recognize that this kind of plot line depends upon people already being familiar with "the way things are", in order to question the wisdom of their being that way, and so this kind of story depends upon the very thing it's against, in order to make sense.

The juxtaposition of the two couples was very poignant and more successful than in a similar movie, the second of the Mummy movies by SommerThe Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition)with Brandon Frasier and Rachel Weisz playing the "good couple", where a similar pair of couples highlights the difference between mere passion and true devotion.

I really enjoyed this Blu-ray release!Now, of course, comparing the special features to other animated classics from Disney on Blu-ray, it may seem that "Bambi" has less special features.

apart from imaginative play, I'm pretty neutral about it, since it's based on a TV show, and my daughter's not able to fully voice her stories about them...yet.  Would like to see if the other characters from the series make it into additional sets.	Just like Bambi I really enjoy watching the behind the scenes documentaries and learning about the creative process that goes on with the masters of Walt Disney magic from the collaboration of a gifted writer and team of animators to the award winning voice talents of legendary actors like Angela Lansbury along with the innocent and soothing voices of Paige OHara who plays Belle and Robby Benson best known for his voice over work on the animated TV series The Legend of Prince Valiant whom of course lends his talents to the heart and soul of the Beast  	0.4583551287651062
destructive animals are probably all too real for adults to giggle about so the animal shenanigans are probably best appreciated by kids (who are often destructive themselves).	He does many bad deeds throughout the course of the first few chapters and of course its highly unappealing for a childrens cartoon so major changes were made to the title character that simply worked for the best he is brighteyed curious easily manipulated and unbelievably forgetful most young children should be able to relate to him and so should adults who remember what it was like to be Pinocchios age	0.4306069016456604

There is much violence in this film, several dark scenes in the caves, but I like the portrayal of the Northmen as heroes and as a people, people with their own way of life, who could respect a foreigner like Ahmed.

Maybe that's the point, as I've not read the book this is based upon, but it doesn't fit well in my mind of a Disney classic, especially one that formed a major pillar upon which the entire Disney franchise was based upon.

Nevertheless, I feel like I have to mention the bad part because it is present--though fortunately it's subtle here, and doesn't hit us over the head as with several other films, so that it wasn't until just very recently that it even occurred to me to think of it this way.  	I would add that I never quite liked its rosy look at the end of the film  I found the idea somewhat cheap instead of romanticMore than that the stage musical included a few very important dialogues which had been deleted from the film but which give a lot of depth to Belles and the Beasts relationship eg when she realizes and tells him that they are quite similar to one another despite everything because she is an outsider too this new edition would have been a good opportunity to implement them but again it was missed	0.5138198137283325

I expected something incredible and to tell you the truth, I was pretty much expecting better picture quality in HD and lossless audio quality with the same special features and maybe a new audio commentary and possibly a retrospective featurette, but Disney has surpassed my expectations by giving us way more than what we would have expected for this film and I'm impressed and also very grateful.

The juxtaposition of the two couples was very poignant and more successful than in a similar movie, the second of the Mummy movies by SommerThe Mummy Returns (Widescreen Collector's Edition)with Brandon Frasier and Rachel Weisz playing the "good couple", where a similar pair of couples highlights the difference between mere passion and true devotion.	0.07423979789018631

I enjoy part one way more than part two, but what is a sick day marathon without  both chapters of the story.  	For the most part Id say Alias is just a bit more familyfriendly for lack of a better term and certainly a whole lot more intelligent and developed than the ABC promos ever suggested Phase One starts off as a very adultoriented and shallow episode though before catching fire and becoming one of the great episodes of the series	0.44257280230522156

The layers of depth here are beautifully examined, albeit in a sing-song and rather kid friendly manor, so that even adults can walk away feeling something in their hearts (which is precisely why this garnered that Best Picture nomination).

i like the material quality but the way it's made - not so much, so very neat.	It is certain that Alice in Wonderland acts as a metaphor for dreams, but the Alice Stories seems to delve deeper... into a primal archetype --a "template" if you will-- out of which human circumstances arise.	0.1779503971338272
I just felt that something was missing, that the script didn't delve deep enough into the potential the first half and the Max Fischer character offered.	What wasnt obvious was that the wonderful Howard Ashman was already then dieing would barely limp through his next movie Beauty and the Beast and would only get around to composing half of the libretto for Aladdin before giving up the ghost	0.3576965034008026

My only complaints -- 1. too many small "filler" pieces that pad the piece count on the box front that you can't use to "build" with and I don't care for stickers -- just include pre "painted" pieces already (example -- the "pies" are pre-decorated parts.	The included brick picker is nice to have to get some of the previously mentioned little parts off of things like base plates	0.3890039920806885

Overall, I am happy I made the purchase because I now have memories of her dancing around singing Christmas songs.....eventually, I may snap the dvd in half though :)	Music would be the focus of the film (the film has more songs than any Walt Disney animated film) and would be loosely based on Lewis Carrol's books (this of course would anger British film and literary critics).But unfortunately, the film would not do well initially at the box office and unlike other Disney films which would be re-released theatrically, "Alice in Wonderland" was not re-released during Walt Disney's lifetime but only on television.  	0.21217016875743866
