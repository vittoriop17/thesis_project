That's right, I said it.
I get this doll after my daughter fall for the movie.
I'm not very happy with this purchase.  
One Upsman-Chip:  Chip and Dale compete to see who can outwit the other last when Chip gets too competitive and Dale ends up in Fat Cat's clutches.  
I love when he meets Jane.
Padding is a bit thin as well.  
I'm yelling SPOILERS for a minute here.
Her face is dotted with freckles and she has a cute smile.
What happened with the Danish Jews has been a story that awes me.
I bought this DVD for my Granddaughter as she loved to watch it at my house and always wanted to take it home with her.  
I very much enjoyed this movie.
A beautiful, honest portrait of the true complexities of adventuring beyond our limits.
The filmmakers bring us a reverse Geppetto-type figure, one that exists only to threaten or bring further harm and humiliation to Pinocchio.
I give it five stars for pretend play and no batteries required.
He's devestated when she runs off to Niagra Falls to marry her flaky boyfriend.  
The only reason why its popular is that Disney uses this film just to sell car toys to little kids.
Under each door there is a little pocket that is filled with pretend rocks along with treasures inside.
The animation team at Disney out did themselves with this movie.

It doesn't stand up the bed, but hey... not a flaw.
If you love a good story, then yes as well.
and it duh sam thang
"When You Wish Upon a Star" of course is the main anthem of The Walt Disney Company; but the other compositions, such as "Give A Little Whistle", "I've Got No Strings", "Little Wooden Head", and "Hi-Diddle-Dee-Dee" are arguably just as good, if not better.
It's interesting to see how the script evolved, but don't expect extra cartoons.
Its Cute and adorable, made with good quality, the niece LOVES it.
So see Cars for the terrific animation and the laughs, or see it as a tribute to Route 66, the Mother Road, but either way, it's a marvelous film.
This is one of the cutest costumes I've ever seen!
And you can't beat the price, even if she only uses it for 3 or 4 months!
I guess after 20 years the movie industry has improved.
Some of the mermaid scene might be too frightening for younger children.
Within 10 min, the disc was skipping, and so it was sent back.
I did find it odd that the first third of the film is presented in 1.66:1 which is pillar boxed on your screen and then it opens to full widescreen 2.35:1 close to the 25 minute mark.
If nothing else, the color restoration and elimination of film grain are both excellent.
This doll is in the size range of most fashion dolls and will fit in nicely with any fashion doll, or fairytale doll collection.  
But all of this happens after the language question and the previews.
They are young and talented and making their way into the world.  
Well worth it.
I'm sure kids and grown-ups will be delighted to watch, I certainly loved it!
Highly recommend instant video from Amazon.  
a. classic.picture:very good HD remastering.
I first saw "Miracle at Midnight" years ago on TV.
You just can't forget the lyrics to them.  
Not great quality, but it's a toddler set.
We're very happy with the quality and accuracy.
The package contains 3 discs in a cleverly designed package.
Yes, Wigand is a "commodity" -- Bergman (Pacino) needs him for his show, but he also comes to have a genuine affection for him.  
It looks great on my daughter's Minnie bed frame.
Or you know, don't even offer a cake of that size- -heavens, no!
Thus, "The Insider" is a great movie that will draw you in with the engaging plot, incredible acting, and the real-life setting based on a true story.  
A girl who likes princesses and board games should enjoy this!
If your budget only allows for 1 Disney 3D movie and you are trying to figure out whether to buy this one, or the Lion King, I'd recommend this one (at least on the basis of the 3D--you would have to decide which story you like better.)What really throws me is that both movies were released at the same time in 3D, and the 3D quality is so different.
Any guess what she liked best?
The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again!  
He's cute and a little dirty, just like in the movie.
These aren't really matchbox quality which is what I had in mind when purchasing for my four year old.
The only thing is that I had big feet when I was born and if she does too, I can tell that the booties may not fit so well.
This is a must have movie.
So if you are looking for a soft one that the kids can sleep with or take naps with then this is it.
He still plays with it, but it doesn't talk.
this is a beautiful comforter that goes great in just about any room.  
I ALWAYS SHOP AT AMAZON.COM FOR MY SPECIAL NEEDS!
It is a good story with great characters, who despite being cars, you can sympathize and empathize with.
Bought these for my son who loves Monsters Inc. I would like these better if some of the figures weren't placed on a stand.
My granddaughter can only sleep with soft characters so was very excited to get this in addition to her talking Sofia.
Maurice's Invention Workshop Game4.
A lot of excitement...a lot of interesting relational elements and twists.  
The child is left to make up their own words.  
This toy is not been keeping up with my 5 year old, and I am waiting for it to completely fall apart!
All the classic cast is there.  
One viewing, and you'll understand the hype.
But it was the storylines that truly drew me.
I like all of these movies and love Disney.  
A bloodstained bed has a gruesome glimpse of a body with its heart taken out.
im so happy to have these.
Soft and lovable, our daughter loves it!
The voice of Willie the Giant is played by Billy Gilbert who also voiced Sneezy from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
She does it all.  
Despite how people may have been misrepresented in the film and how situations were dramatized, I think that Roger Ebert said it best in his review of the film back in 1999, "There is, I admit, a contradiction in a film about journalism that itself manipulates the facts.
Excellent for the Jake's Neverland Tiki-------------additional imagination!
This has become a classic in the Disney stable for a reason and if you haven't watched this yet you should be pleased with the story and animation on offer.
But just a head's up...  there may be a bit too much violence for a younger child.  
Look so cute and makes the room so pretty with the beautiful colors!
They are just the right size and she will have them to play with when the party is over.  
I guess we'll never get tired of seeing Chip N' Dale, along with the Australian-accented cheese-loving Moneterey Jack (AKA Monty), the beautiful (for a mouse) female inventor Gadget, & plucky fly Zipper fight the likes of the feline mobster Fat Cat & the mad human scientist Professor Nimnul.  
I love this film, its so adorable.
To the seller and to the staff & management of Amazon.
I purchased this for my granddaughter who is a big Phineas and Ferb fan.
The first player to fill all three wins.
toys are great, the tote is fun, and who doesn't like to pretend to play dress up?!
Highly recommended!!
Another Disney movie that didn't disappoint me.
"On My Way" Sing-Along Song- Bear Legends: Native American Tales-
really enjoyed this movie  i wish that there could have been more made after these with the same stars  they all seem to fit together and i really enjoyed watching it
recording abilityy excellenty and colors very pretty
It is really a cute movie.
We ended up playing our own version of "Finding Nemo" when she flushed it.
Has a lot to say about relationships, believe it or not...........:0)
The Royal Navy has taken the Flying Dutchman's Captain hostage and now intends to destroy the pirate presence in the Caribbean for good.
Would love to see more Tangled Legos be added.
It sort of freaked my daughter out a little.
Furthermore, how many of us have wondered if we continue to dream after we die?
It is such a treasure for those who appreciate the really creative few among us, who just know things.
This truck was the same price but the transporter (back) section was of cheaper quality.
I love this movie because not only is there a great moral to the story but it is very family friendly.
Only wish they showed the dogs a little more.
Walt Disney sounds like Walter Cronkite.
This might sound fun, but the one disappointment that comes out of this, is that it can only be played during the film.
Beauty and the Beast is a wonderful story that people of all ages will enjoy.  
I didn't really know what the plot was when I saw it the first time but after I watched the show I have to say I was impressed, so I very much enjoyed this program and bought this as a gift for someone who likes it even more than I do.  
Viking prayer: “Lo, there do I see my father.
This movie is like something from another galaxy.
A couple of notes: 1) the doll's hair is long and will get tangled so we just used a hair-band to give Ariel a long ponytail and that works fine; 2) it's hard to get her to sit when the removable fish tail/fin is on.  
Some that are new and many from the past release.
But it is.
This movie, especially in the new blu ray edition is truly  work of art.
I strongly suggest this product for any princess party or event.
Madison is 6 the doll is cute
Just about everyday after school my siblings, cousins and I would to go to my grandparents house and watch these on tv.
I bought 2 for 2 different lil boy different ages and they both liked them.
I'm hoping for an upgraded quality copy of this to see the light of day.
I've already mentioned the cricket, cat, and fish.  
Brother Bear 2 is ok, but I purchased the Blue Ray for Brother Bear.  
Not really a big deal to me.
It would recommend it to a friend.
They seem to be durable and are holding up well.
He drags our leading character from one animated short to another.
Childhood memory favorite, really enjoyed seeing it again and having it bring back many fun and happy memories of my youth!
Great for younger kids, all in one with attached sword and headband.
If you like to enjoy a movie where dialogues have some sarcasm and intelligent lines, this movie would be the right choice.
Beauty and the Beast could very well be my favorite Disney movie- tied with Tangled.  
I always wondered why she had such a cheapo looking seat - but now I understand - it's about what works and what requires the least clean-up.
I was a diehard fairy tale fan.
The effects animation in Pinocchio is an entirely different matter, but it might well just be the greatest achievement of the whole film: from the fire that Pinocchio cooks up to make Monstro sneeze to the glow whenever the Blue Fairy appears, and from the shadows of Lampwick and Pinocchio to the water splashes made by Monstro himself (the water ripples are perhaps the most beautiful thing drawn by anyone in the Golden Age of Animation), the effects animation by itself represent a level of artistry that cannot be matched by today's computers.
Miss this show, I'm surprised it had a short run!!!  
"Alice in Wonderland" is a film that was just begging for a high-definition home transfer & now that it has been released in Blu-ray, you can see that this is true.
Some movie critics in 1992 didn't enjoy this film.
So the board game itself did not go over well.
Just like the character from the movies.  
It is funny and interesting the messes he got him self stuck in.
Not to mention how dangerous it can be because the back falls out leaving the batteries exposed.
However, the mat is very thin.
Younger children will love the colorful universe that appears onscreen.
The blow dryer is so much fun for her!!
There he finds Clayton, Jane Porter, and Professor Archimedes Q. Porter.
Its mixture of comedy and romance, coupled with excellence of production, makes it a perennial favorite for children and adults alike.
The movie weaves a tale of honor, strength of character and courage.  
Its a rely good move for family's to see.
In fact since the invention of film at the turn of the 20th century not a decade has gone where at least one (and usually several) fresh renderings of the Alice story been told in moving pictures.
Feeling that she might not return, the Beast gives her the mirror so that she can always see and remember him whenever she wishes.  
The aggrieved mother ape finds the child, calls him Tarzan, and wants to adopt him as her child.
In Pinocchio, the works of these animators remains at least one of their three best (in Reitherman's case, I'd call Monstro his all-time best work).
It's my fifth time viewing this feature.
The locals are frightened and the Vikings determined but uneasy... that night, the main hold is attacked and two of them slain.
Well, the first time I tried to remove them from the sides of the tub, one of the suction cups ripped right out of the side, so of course it won't inflate with a gaping hole in the side.
That's why I think Dory is funny and brave.
As I've heard, the region 1 version edits out Pecos Bill's cigarette.  
This is so cute and I expect him to start singing any minute!!  
DOLL I PURCHASED AT THE DISNEY STORE!
If you like Tim Allen and like to laugh, this is just the ticket.
The time it would take to explain a character's persona, such as Belle or Gaston, is condensed into a three or four minute song.
or she gets a tad frustrated trying to get it open.
An Alice Comedy: Alice's Wonderland* Original Theatrical Trailers (1951 & 1974)*
Though first I will say that, on the whole, the film is rather dull, the one good thing about it is John Turturro who offers a brilliant, vivid performance, I will watch the movie when it's on occasionally simply to listen to him, he's a delight.  
It was a hit and the disc played as advertised.  
A Disney classic.
It's a classic.
I was especially careful with Prince James, since he didn't look too steady standing on that base with stick-like legs...but all the characters survived the de-packaging.  
The whole dvd was great, but my wife and grand-daughters loved Humfrey the Bear abd ranger" put it in the bag bump1 bump!
I would definitely recommend this for families with girls who will enjoy the play pieces even when the guessing cards lose their challenge and charm.
Now truthfully, I bought this movie for my sister, which is why it lacks the last star.
This disc didnt work and they said I could keep it?
They are 15 months old and all it is ever used for is to be thrown out of the crib.
They become best friends, and they work for a company that transports things.
He has become the friend's child's favorite toy.  
Had to wait a little while to get it as it traveled a bit, but I expected this so not a problem.
Ursula goes on to talk about how talking is overrated and men don't like that anyway.
It was a little slow and  lengthy at times but over all we enjoyed it.  
Now I have copies to share with my grandchildren.
I know this item is aged for 3 years and up
A Creep In the Deep: A deranged fish vows declares war on the human race and vows to free captive fish everywhere.  
She will be so excited when she sees this in her Easter basket.
Toys R us was sold out and still is.
when I was 9 years old.
Since we are visiting my mom, I went to the store and bought one
they are quite big, so you can use for couple months for sure.
A great storyline that is fun and exciting.
Ted Thomas, a son of one of the original artists, visits other children of the "Nine Old Men" to discuss how was life growing up with their father.
When the original movie was made, the Disney animators sought to create a specific look, full of graceful lines, subtle tones, and naturalistic color.
By painting the smile, Gepetto is the author of Pinocchio's personality and the creative 'father' of the puppet, if not the literal 'father' of the would-be boy.
There is nothing about the film that makes you think it was created before 1953.  
Though I wish Disney would retain the filmic look of their classic animated films by not scrubbing away the grain the way they do, preferring instead they go for a more natural film-like approach a la Studio Ghibli and their titles on Blu-ray, I gotta admit that the way they do things in hi-def still looks very impressive.
They discover that gangster Tony Dracon is running a protection racket, and Elisa seems to have joined him.  B32.  
This was for my niece to wear on her trip to Disney World and she loved it!  
Brother Bear (Two-Disc Special Edition) is a 2003 Disney film that is a story about Kenai who is the youngest of three brothers.
"The Little Mermaid" Diamond Edition is a 2-Disc set.
He also works at seducing a young teacher who works at the school and who he falls deeply in love with.  
I remember many of these from the Disney TV show during the 1950s, and seeing them lovingly restored is a real pleasure.
But i watch it with them as well.  
Ducktales is just about the world's richest duck going around the world getting richer.  
Also, it would be really helpful to have the shoe size-range listed somewhere...the shoes are all way too big for my daughter at the moment!
The Right Duck:  After being fired by Scrooge, Launchpad enters the space program, and accidentally gets sent to Mars.  
Difficult to have these figures play together on the spots where more than one character should fit like the top decks.  
They are as you can guess, amazed.
I personally would not get it for a child unless you are a collector yourself.
I purchased this tinkerbell doll for my 4 year old daughter.  
This is a classic.
He loved it.
My daughters loved it and so does my husband and me.
The 3rd Volume is really the best if you are just after some 80s nostalgia.
The monsters themselves are funny, creative, and very well-done.
We gave these Disney fairies to my daughter for her 3rd birthday and she plays with them nearly every day.  
When we were visiting DisneyLand, it was cold in the evenings, and everyone asked us where we purchased this hat.
Great Disney movie.
We also bought the rock action set.  
His head and waist turn.  
I loved the writing in this movie.
As far as I know, he is really enjoying it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is a great movie for all ages, I find myself watching it along with them every single time.
He is a very solid doll, as handsome in real life as he is in film, and his clothes are accessories are just as dashing as he!  
Fun and Fancy Free is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on September 27, 1947.
Too bad this is a Minnie Waffle maker in her eyes.  
I really enjoyed the second season of this series, although I lamented the fact that we spent much more time in the spy world than we did in season one.
It is a great car movie.
These figurines have plastic dicsc attached to their feet so they can stand up.
OK I am all for political correctness, however this film is not believable, it has no story line and the acting is non-existent.
I want that ship.....
3d was OK ...
The premise is simple and everyone knows it: A prince is cursed and becomes a beast.
Still as informative and entertaining as it was back then.
The Spot:  Ex-employee of Stark Industries, Dr. Jonathan Ohn, invents a portable interdimensional technology that accidentally makes him the living embodiment of a portal.
It was a good video although an older one.
The only caveat would be that it says don't wash it, spot clean it.  
I could hardly get through to the end.
I love this movie!  
Kiss the Girl was also nominated for Original Song.
You won't be disappointed.
No to mention that duo John Goodman and Billy Crystal is brilliant.
That's how it was designed.
It won't be used for long but it will work until my daughter can sit up with out slipping all over the place.
Colors are vibrant and really come out with clarity and as always with Disney, their frame-by-frame restoration shows as there is not one blemish at all.  
A Bug's LifeC. Melody TimeD. The Spirit of MickeyE. Pocahontas II: Journey to a New WorldF. Lady and the TrampMusic Video* Part of Your World
The price is much better than the stores.
but oh so appropriate and definitely emotionally satisfying.  
It's clever, fun, redemptive, silly, wholesome.
It makes me feel sad that she is alone with a nanny all the time, but she has great friends at the hotel.
This delightful favorite is actually enhanced by the skillful 3-D rendering.
In the end it's all a dream, she is awakened by her sister's voice, and as the two of them return home for teatime where she realizes that perhaps logic and reason exist for purpose.
The story unfolds when an overprotective but dedicated father, Marlin, loses his son, Nemo, to human divers looking to populate their fish tank naturally.  
On You - Part TwoOn a Wing and a BearA Star is TornA Touch of GlassThe
Great packaging for a really great movie from the makers of Toy Story, Pixar.
For young and older.
Must get if you liked as a kid and to those who think the kids shows of today are a little dumb down for their own kids.
I can't wait to take pictures of my baby wearing this set.
The doll is very very cheap in person.
Any car nut with a broad spectrum interest in the automobile will find lots of different cars from different eras getting face time on this movie.
It's very funny.
This set is simply divine.
commentary).But the star of Brother Bear is Jeremy Suarez as Koda.
I have vol 1, but until vol 3 comes out, not interested in this to have 2/3 of the series.
My daughter will love this for christmas.  
My daughter saw this at Disney and fell in love.
It's a cute, funny, clean, and well animated series that always has a good story for each episode.  
It's great to have kids or grandkids and have excuses to see movies like this one.
I could not find it in our local stores.
For that price, they were a decent buy....
The actors do an excellent job, with action scenes that are credible without showing a lot of gore.  
My three year old grandson got this from us for part of his birthday gift.
Where in season one we had the opportunity to watch Sydney juggle her home life and college career with her work as a spy, in the second season a large part of that is missing as Francie is now the only member of her inner circle that doesn't know her secret and her college career is all but missing (with the exception of a shot of Sydney in her graduation gown).
I soon forgot it was Crowe and thorougly got into the mind of Wigand.  
I really wish Disney would focus more on other balanced films than this.  
It's great to have good, clean and fun cartoons again.
Our children and our grandchildren are enjoying this movie with us!
Elfrego Baca is new to me.  
Since I like to follow the races myself, I chose to watch it too.
I'm usually not a fan of plastic toys, but this set has brought my son a lot of joy.
The quality is great and he's just the right size for my son to carry around with him and for him to sleep next to him in bed.
Someone like me could never properly put into words the work that has been created here.  
The scores are wonderful, spread out throughout the movie, and appropriately placed such that they do not distract from dialogue or action.  
Please don't purchase for more than $14.95, as another review mentioned it would be a rip off.  
But I would have paid the price for the movie alone, and did get to enjoy some of the bonus features.
She was in so much distress and no adult was around to soothe, calm or listen to her.
By the saints, nay!!!
The quality is much better in blu Ray.
I inflated this Garanimals bath tub with an electric pump.
I really like this movie.
All the madcap zaniness happens TO Alice!
I grew up with the Muppet Show as "must see TV."  Very grateful to be able to share the same thing with my kids.  
One missionary's experience.  
and I love mermaids!
You simply cant beat a classic it will never out grow the youth of this world.
It was worth the effort as other than that, she's a great doll with the ability to bend at elbows, knees, hips, feet, and hands.
In any case, my wife got him a Fisher-Price Ducky potty for his room and a "Cars" seat which fits onto our bathroom toilet seat.
Sloane believes his wife may still be alive.
This is a delightful movie, but there was an unexpectedly scary part that the boys...ages 4 and 5...didn't like.
he will stay a beast if never found any love.  
He positions them here and there but doesn't seem to run them a lot.  
I almost bought this on Amazon.fr.
Who puts rubber bands on child's toy and expects them to stay there?
I probably should have watched it then.  
I only noticed two scenes (and they last only a second or two) where the new 3d angles don't match up.
Great product a must own!!
The pieces are oddly shaped, but that doesn't seem to matter to my 3 year old.
I don't really like this movie.  
Fortunately, the main feature performed flawlessly, but the bonus features were a different story.
And the plot is entertaining for children and adults as well.  
Pinocchio was great back when I was a kid in the Bronx, NY and it's still a classic when I'm 64!
Despite high standards all around, though, Pixar reliably comes through with the best in scripts and characterization, on top of cutting edge technology.
While you can notice some flickering of the outlines on characters, they're never distracting to me.
Reaching the top of a given industry can be serendipitous, sure but this one here represents proof of the gradual climbing process that separates this studio from the others.
I bought this one to replace the one my son broke.
Instead of being his normal cranky self he's down right hateful.
She can't understand why Tinks costume looks more yellow than green!
This is a fun film, filled with plenty of humor and excitement.  
Come on, you can have George Lucas or Stephen Speilberg help you make it better, like they did with E.T. and Star Wars (ep 4 - 6).  
But until then, Stromboli plans to make the puppet his "little wooden goldmine.
But there's also plenty of animation that looks a bit choppy or perhaps unrefined, as if the film was under a time crunch.
We saw the movie and love it, and she'd been eyeballing the doll for a while.
I don't see this Buzz making it to next year.  
It never gets old.
Pooh is the only one who has received the advice from Christopher that they need to keep going, but he can't remember what it is, in typical Pooh fashion.
I don't have children, but I enjoy a good quality cartoon and I find myself enjoying this movie.  
We have watched this movie so many times on DVD that we have worn out several discs.
Wore out one on the second one now.
A woman beats a man over the head, knocking him unconscious.
Didn't have good songs, didn't really seem that endearing, I don't know.  
There are little puzzle piece doors with different characters and then when it's your turn you pick a card that tells you what treasure to find (ex: pink shell, statue, anything purple, etc.) and you add that to the pile of things everyone is looking for, spin the spinner and that will tell you which puzzle piece door to lift (ex: Ariel or King Triton) and then you lift and look to see if there are any of those treasures under that door.
If only there were such shows today.  
Audio and video is spotless of course.
Finally, the coachman on the Pleasure Island excursion is the most extreme of all villains in the movie, a devil who oversees the transformation of young boys into mindless donkeys.  
Oh the shark has pretty teeth dear, And he shows them pearly white Just a jack-knife has
I am not so happy that the white isn't so white.
This 1951 movie would have played in theaters with the then standard aspect ratio of 1.37:1.  
This is one of the most beautiful Disney dolls.
I brought this for $15.
I hate it when there are talking cars.
Those people totally downgrade every movie and make this movie to be all horrible when they clearly have no idea what they're talking about.
It is a nice addition to the set.
You have to watch the plain DVD copy if you want some of the original extras.
What's there to say?
I first bought this dvd for my grandaughter, now age 8.  
This is definitely a timeless classic that is worth having in any collection!
In the book, Tarzan eventually finds some papers telling who they are, but in this version his gorilla mother (OK; foster mother) finds a picture of them and their baby.
would watch it again and again.
Especially in 3D.
Nothing is less fun than a headless Woody doll.  
Their boss is a woman named Rebecca.
The soundtrack is awesome too.
Watching Rushmore from the perspective of 2014--a time when you've already seen Moonrise Kingdom and the Darjeeling Limited--the 1998 film exudes a sense of nostalgia--this was Wes Anderson when his techniques and storytelling talents were still developing.
Over all this film is enjoyable it is done realy well and your will enjoy this film.
A Wonderful Family All Time Classic, it is timeless and is loved by children and adults.
It's crisp and clear and vivid, a delight to watch.  
Can't wait to start trading.
If you're an avid collector of Disney's Blu-ray upgrades, the "Brother Bear / Brother Bear 2" 3-Disc Special Edition is an essential entry in your home movie collection.
Pan" has something for everyone.
This brush is small yet totally working, it is perfect for litlle girl's hands to do the styling and brushing.
Certainly worth upgrading from the DVD to the blu ray...deserves the accolades & is a must have for folks w 3D television capability...
next up is "A Lad in a Lamp" where an old lamp with a genie in it gets released by Monty then accidently switches place with both as it falls in the hands of Fat-Cat but can Gadget, Chip and the rest save our cheese-loving hero?.
In the first season Brad is getting into trouble at an arcade, and in the last season he's getting busted for smoking pot.
A toddler size pillow would be a better choice.
Bambi is a charming classic film that the whole family can enjoy, if you have not seen the movie you might want to be aware that there are alot of sad tear jerking scenes that may leave you in tears, but over all is a beautiful movie.
It's simple coming-of age story is so pure, so fill with heart and so honest that you can't help but stare in awe throughout its all too brief 70 minutes.
Cute & Cuddly!!
Featuring the deleted song "Human Again" and an optional introduction by Don Hahn and another by Alan Menken.
Plastic smells really bad..
In particular, the one about losing one's child at the department store was hilarious and is a highlight of the film.
We like the Lego quality and the price was good too.
Really great songs and a perfect story for both kids and adults.  
The casting is one of the main things that separates this series from the unenjoyable Trasformers.
Thankfully she did not bring Jasmine into the living room where my 9 month old plays.  
For the price it is well enough made, if I'd paid $50 for the costume I'd have higher expextations for it
They sure don't make em like they used to!
and it is well-done too and worth the watch.  
As "Bambi" has had its DVD release in 1997 (as part of the Masterpiece Collection Version) and in 2007 as a Platinum Edition, the film will receive its 2011 Blu-ray release as a Diamond Edition to celebrate it's 70th year.
First let me say that I'm embarrassed to say that I probably haven't seen Disney's Peter Pan since I saw it as a child in the movie theater (and I'm in my 60s!).
This Movie is great for young kids...
It's really cute, and is made of some type of hard plastic-type material, with a fluffy tail.  
it's solid and I won't have to worry about parts breaking off.
I am a huge fan of "Home Improvement", and really loved this complete first season, I will be ordering more of Home Improvement DVD set, thank you.
A must see for all ages.
I love how if I have to baby sit, I can toss this in the blu ray and have hours to myself cuz they love the 3D.However, I will say I am a total sucker for Aladdin, when they make that in 3D I will have that day its out.
If you are looking for a movie where you have drama, comedy and actions.
Long live Ducktales!
Our granddaughter was thrilled.
He still plays with it now.
Alice In Wonderland DVD Storybook* Operation Wonderland*
Best to buy this Chameleon toy now (in the spring) and save it until then.
I also like that the have to press a butten to get the microphone to work.
Pros: A good message, some good acting, a few good scenes and ideas.
Maybe it is my pre-conceptions
little one was very very happy.  
It doesn't add any substantial substance to the plot, but it's a great fun number that doesn't throw the plot off so it's a nice addition.  
Though nothing may ever quite top "Toy Story", "Nemo" belongs on that "1-B" slot right along with "WALL-E" and "Up".
Great for temporary traveling and ah home use.
Anyway, quality wise, it is again okay, nothing that stands out on it to make me say its a must have.  
Like the title says, here's my pick of the top 10 worst sequels of all time:1.
The 13th Warrior has you feeling like you know all the Norsemen within minutes and the  bonding of Banderas' character to the band is perfect.  
A resident of the town stands in the snow, playing a goofy tune on a saxophone.  
So funny and we all seem to remember the lines.  
As usual, Disney produced a gorgeous high-definition transfer that is certainly a feast for the eyes.
An additional 11 effects made it to 25%.The 3D is somewhat inconsistent from scene to scene.
I really enjoy Belle, she's just so beautiful.
Great fun movie with heart, great animation, great story, fun/funny characters that lets all who view it be a kid and laugh and smile and get lost for a bit.
It is nowhere near as arch or twee as his later movies.
5 for technology 2 for storyline.
In keeping with the stage version tradition, Hans Conried voice both George Darling and Captain Hook.
Who thinks of this stuff?  
Now taken to the Broadway stage, this can be enjoyed by kids and grownups alike.
The movie itself is great, Ellen DeGeneres should at least have gotten an academy award for her voice over if not the win.
Love that the blow dryer works... (to the degree a 3-4 yr old needs it to work) and she loves to get ready at her own vanity.
This was the ONE thing Santa omitted since he didn't know about it until Christmas Eve so I was glad Amazon had it as an add-on item to sneak into my next order -- in time for the 7yo's birthday 10 days after Christmas.
The acting was good and the actors good.  
thank you to the seller for a grand overall experience in all areas.
Quiz Show (1994) - John Turturro/Rob Morrow/Ralph Fiennes/Paul Scofield/David Paynmer/Hank Azaria/Christopher McDonald/Mira Sorvino/Martin Scorsese/Barry Levinson/Hamilton Fish/Ileana Douglas/Calista Flockhart (uncredited: Ethan Hawke)
A movie I bought to help complete my collection.
What did we get??  
Sulley for short!)
) Disney Princess7) Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind8) Porco Rosso9)
And I also love that the glitter doesn't come off and get on everything!  
The other actors in it were great especially Dennis Storoi and Vladimir Kulich, and it's not their fault the directors and editor's chopped this film to bits, and it shows when watching it how badly it was pieced together.
I was surprised they would be made this way, especially when the alligator was made normally.
It seems to be working on and off now, Sheesh!
I would recommend this film to anybody, even though it is animated.
Not for the under 3 crowd.
I managed to sit through it because I was determined to see if it was bad all the way through----and it was.
"Talespin" was on my definitely-not-to-be- missed 'Disney Afternoons'.
Haven't used the flat sheet yet because I am not too crazy about the fitted bottom.
It is a must buy for all library.
Surf's Up would do a similar story the very next year after this was made.
What an important and moving piece of work that deserves much more fanfare than it's ever received.
The story is great and the grandkids love the under water detail.
But dark secrets still stand between them.
Beauty and the Beast Music Video - (4:31) Featuring a duet with Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson.  Presented in standard definition and was included in the original 2002 DVD.*
I think that if you just give them a chance, today's young people are as bright and intelligent as any generation.
This been my favorite cartoon since it came out back in 1989 or 1990.
We will have to get them there own copy!
They are about a thumb length, but super accurate.
The fist thing we noticed was the lid of the box was broken.  
Look forward to future buys with you.
Parental guidance is definitely suggested with these movies.
Despite all the so-so (at best) reviews of the transfer of this movie, I went ahead and bought it anyway.
It is very entertaining and I would recommend for any little boy.
Gargoyles was the sh$&%^ when I was younger.
Finding Nemo got old....
Bought this for my 14 month old daughter, she loves it.
She loves giving us all checkups daily and takes it with her when we go to the doctor.  
He becomes a classic part of Walt Disney and will appear in other Disney movies throughout the years.
I remember when I first watched it and being amazed.
Tricks of the Trade - (7:18) Walt Disney talks about the multi-plane technology used on "Bambi".*
However, this is certainly wow worthy!  
It's pretty durable for an inflatable.
Denahi arrives, mistaking Kenai for dead, and his bear form is responsible for it, vows to avenge Kenai.
My unique desire remains unfulfilled in real life, but lives on forever in this breathtaking fairytale.  
3d was Awesome!
It's the equivalent of a late '60s musical in which things are just beginning to roll along when a character sits down and sings.
But the main problem with the lines in this transfer are the white "halos" around them.
it holds my nephew's attention every time we watch it together, and that's saying something.
very cute and comfy.
I just can't get into it for some reason.
Works great though for potty training on the go!
The definition in blu-ray is simply amazing, it's beautiful.  
The story begins at the home of George and Mary Darling whose three children (Wendy, John, and Michael).
One Man Band*: This is the short that was played before the movie in theaters.
After calling Amazon to let them know, I noticed another reviewer wrote the same thing; such a shame and let down for kids.
Compared to the sharpness of earlier masterpieces such as The Jungle Book, Robin Hood and the recent Rango this is just weak.
I was a big fan of the first movie that came out, and I am an even bigger fan of this movie.  
Of course his troubles are behind him.  
This is a really funny movie.
Every scene he was in was funny.
Seen her excited about Alice and the rabbit brought back feelings of how I enjoyed it when I originally watched it.
Together, these toys really look like they walked out of the Toy Story movies, so I highly recommend them.
I bought Beauty and the Beast in 3d for my daughter to see...and it was really great!  
Elisa and Broadway, in traditional noir fashion investigate his case in order to find him in the clutches of Dracon and his grandfather Dominick, a suspected member of the Illuminati.  
They are sturdy, and look just like the little characters.
Deleted scenes and outtakes are included as well.
My daughters both love this doll, but I think she is a bit funny.  
It's not bad, it just feels a little contrived and heavy-handed at times.  
He then embarks on a recue mission with Dory, a Regal Blue Tang, as his companion.
This is a far cry from Miami Vice in plot.  
My son has been carrying it around the house shouting BUZZ!
I'll return them, but am really bummed.
Nothing new can be said about this - Disney brought the incredible legend of Davy to everyone.  
It shows what the animators could have done if they hadn't been restrained by the need to appeal to an unsophisticated audience.
Crazy right, but so worth the buy if were a Winnie the Pooh fan.
I ordered 3 palace pets for my 2 1/2 year old for Valentine's Day.
He's on his second wife, we later learn, a beautiful Southern belle, and they enjoy a huge home with pool, and an altogether very comfortable lifestyle.
It had been ages since I had this movie.
It didn't help that he kept the film relatively low-budget.
I would recommend them.
You'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a 70-year old film you're looking at.
Aerial's fascination over the statue of a man is admirable as well, and while he's away could help keep her faithful.  
The way the mystery unfolds is top-notch, and the animation is excellent quality.  
The Blu-ray is a digital transfer of the director's cut, which was supervised by director Wes Anderson with a DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack.
I've not seen the Blu-ray yet (if I get lucky I'll get one a month or so before the official release) but am told the picture and sound are, quite simply, astounding.
Plenty of drama and heroics for men, and heartfelt, teary moments for women.
His overprotective mother (Swoozy Kurtz)basically seals him off from the outside world.  
I wanted to expose my grandchildren to the Muppets and this was a wonderful way to do it.
I am a real big fan of cartoons but nothing comes close to this.
The animation stands up as being detailed and well lit and it's just awesome to see how well the storyline ties together with the newly released prequel.  
As an older adult, I found this story to be a great morale booster.
Great condition and arrived on time.
I have to take 20 words to talk about this?
This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews.
On You - Part
It is Belle who saves him in the end, again turning a stereotype on its head.
Definite Recommend!!!
My son loves this movie, it ranks amongst his favorites alongside Monsters Inc., UP, and Wall-E.
I love that they stand on puzzle pieces so that you can stand them up.
Great value for my money.
This goes back to when I was a Kid and Davy Crockett was very popular!
The only thing was that I didn't realize it needed batteries which wasnt an issue for the AAA's...
One negative I have is that the comforter developed a little tear in it after several washes.
We used these on top of my daughter's birthday cake when she turned 7.  
This movie is great...like most of the DISNEY animations, i recommend this classic to everyone!!!!
As a matter of fact, a director of many Dick Van Dyke Show episodes, Jerry Paris, directed this delightful Disney comedy.  
I loved it so much that I finally decided to purchase it.
I enjoyed it.  
Walt Disney company should not have tried to add to perfection.
My Daughter LOVES anything Disney Princess,
Gargoyles is one of the great lost cartoons with great story which more people should watch and enjoy this great story.
Firing him would have been much cheaper than sending his daughter away to college, but there you have it, the complexities of a simple minded story.  
But I had somehow connected that with the forest fire, which in fact took place the following spring.
Two thumbs and two toes way up :D
I got the top of the line and they were bored
If you like odd characters, strange behaviors, weird situations, bizarre creatures, and just plain unusualness all around, seen with the eyes of a protagonist who's as dignified and polite as the world is strange, then what you're looking for can probably be found in Wonderland.
In ways I felt the same about this movie as I did with Gnomeo and Juliet.
It's a little harder to keep everything together when you have 8 little hands rummaging through the toy container.
I purchased the bluray years ago but it didn't come with a digital copy.
You can make the keys play notes that sound like a keyboard or bubbles or a frog or a bird.  
We've had Snow for a while now and she still looks great and that is amazing in itself.
If the critical faculties in your mind are active while you're watching this, you may have trouble staying with it from the very start of the second film, and the third one is worse.
I made waffle/pancakes for my family for breakfast and the more I used the more the waffles/pancakes become less and less cooked.
Many superfluous scenes that make no sense whatsoever - the mass executions in the first scene, the escape of Calypso (never to be seen again), the involvement/under-use of Chow Yun Fat.
Does Pavlov Ring A Bell?:
It made me think that the White Rabbit really relates to many adults as we rush around with our time lines and agendas.  
Love these two talented ladies teaming up!  
It's too bad this transfer is not.
So nice that he has something that looks like theirs with a boy theme.  
Introducing actor Chris Pine (alias  young James T. Kirk) as the handsome, exuberant gentle Nicholas; Mia's proposed-elect, also the nephew of ever-scheming royale uncle Mabrey, loftily accused of trying to steal MIa's rightful crown.
It arrived within the alloted time frame and was well packaged.  
There is only one scary scene where Mater and Lightening go "tractor tipping" and a large tractor named "Frank" chases them through the field.  
Many of those posting the negative reviews even admit that their children enjoy the stories.
In addition he makes sure they are together.
The surrealism does a better job of portraying the absurdity of our modern world than any other piece.
Despite the cliche Disney animated musical elements we have to remember this was one of the first of the new musicals for them and they really do a great job storytelling and animating it.
Not sure what it is about this puzzle that she didn't like.
The always sensible Alice whirls through a world of contradictions, imagination and surprises where she encounters amazing creatures - including a pocket watch-toting White Rabbit, the imperious Queen of Hearts and her army of playing cards, a Cheshire Cat with a lingering smile in an unforgettable fantasy, and the off-kilter Madhatter - and tests her sensibility and courage.
I do appreciate the 3D, it was done well, but not made for3D originally.  
and they love replaying it over and over again.
It has been great for clean up and for transporting for play outside the house.  
The final TV special is a January 1965 broadcast of "Disneyland's 10th Anniversary Show", six months before the actual 10th anniversary date.  
I really didn't care for this movie, my 15 year old loves it the 3 years old could care less about it.
I was amazed at how much she has played with it.
I don't see how that can be a good plot, especially for a fairy tale--fairy tales and folklore are meant to teach the way things are as well as the way things ought to be, so that we see how the way things are don't measure up, and justice is served thereby where it often isn't in real life.  
My child plays with it no end for the last two years and this doll looks always like a new doll.2.Hair is beautiful, rooted, long and silky and super gorgeous, styled to perfection and adorned with golden bands just like the movie character.3.
This is another Disney movie that never gets old.
Plus there are positively no characters I care for, and belle looks typical until she enters the "enchanted castle" for a much needed makeover.
He's taken several rides in the washing machine and is still looking brand new.
It has a great plot line, and it's not preachy, just fun!!
I don't know why I love this movie!!!  
Great feel good movie filled with laughter and fun!  
This really helps to preserve the tradition.  
All of these toys fit into the other action set as well.
but before that..3.
It also includes and extended version which has an extra song.
Packaging was great and there were no loose discs.
$24 bucks at Best Buy!!!!
He loves it.  
I have yet to purchase a Disney or a Disney/Pixar blu ray release that has disappointed me.
Really happy with my purchase.
The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea2)
I purchased one of these in December at the Disney store and the one I received was obviously not the authentic Disney store version.  
In a nutshell, a little red race car named Lightning McQueen has issues, particularly he's selfish, narcissistic, and doesn't need a pit crew.
The box says it's good for ages 4 and up, and I think it is more appropriate for younger kids.
If you have earlier versions - even with the bonuses and, again, have a BD and HD TV, and truly love the film (don't we all?)then, again, go for it.
We bought this Figurine set because it was suggested by amazon to buy with the clubhouse play set.
Rather long winded storyline but rings true in the end:  
Again, these are observations that I've made, my daughter doesn't care, and is happy playing with them.  
Sing A Long - Watch the movie with karaoke style Sing A Long.*
The movie was interesting enough to sit through to the end, but I never quite cared that much about any of the main characters.
My love of wolves brings me back to this gem at least once a year (I watch it with my Siberian Husky).
i watch it several times a year.
This review is not on the movie itself.
The colors, the characters, the songs, and the storylines are incredible!
Truth be told, some of the scenes in `Tarzan' feel over stuffed with action and yet it lacks a substance I wanted to see here.  
It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives.
With a quick mend it was all fixed up, so I thought.  
Great quality, love the colors.
The second of these creations, FUN AND FANCY FREE (1947) consists of remnants of what had originally bern planned as two separate feature films.
I fixed it no matter what this movie was worth every penny u pay for it!!
Hope it works out for everyone!
While my daughter doesn't know the difference and enjoys it any way I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't the one pictured.
Be careful with the sellers encouraging you to spend more than you have to.  
I've had many similar dreams which turn from day to night while I'm trying to find my car which has disappeared.
The actresses are brilliant and the story is fresh and hilarious.
First Disney princess I watched in the U.S I love it that my daughters and I can watch over and over on our devices wherever we go because of the digital copy.
I searched High and low and finaly found some at Target a couple of cities away.
It is fun and entertaining.
I have not yet seen this movie, but I know that I will love it too along with all the other 3 movies.
This video has been seen by my Grandaughter at least 50 times - It is a classic - I never tire of it either.
The animation is fantastic, the artistic backgrounds painted for this film is spectacular and if anything, it's a different kind of animated film that Disney has done before.
From the pictures and descriptions I expected the Mickey CD to have Mickey singing songs, Minnie's songs, ect.  
My 3 year old granddaughter loves Tarzan but likes Tarzan II better.
JOHN GOODMAN VOICE MATCHED THE CHARACTER.  
She saw this movie on Amazon and had to have it, so we got it of course.
But as much as Brother Bear fails musically, it succeeds in terms of story, character and beauty.
An unlikely love triangle between a unique oddly brilliant 'cool geek'teenager, his teacher and a local business tycoon that'ssimultaneously funny, absurd and heartbreaking.
A film as vibrant and colorful as this one was bound to get a blu ray release.
I especially loved how the Beast started to mature through the film and begin to care for Belle, unlike Gaston, the pig-headed monster taught us all that just because a guy is good-looking and talented in every way possible doesn't mean he's the guy to get the girl, he's more like the spoiled creep who pushes people around!
The Blu-ray version of "Peter Pan" leaves nothing to be desired; the technical aspects are extraordinarily well done.  
Happy that I can now watch with my children.
The old DVD used to crop off the sides of the 2:33-1 portion to keep the screen filled at 1:85-1.There should have been a warning that the first 24 minutes were window-boxed and the rest of the film would be wide-screen 2:33-1.
But be careful of some of the prices out there.
The kids at least were great actors (though I still found Schroeder's bickering irritating, while I normally don't like Lauren
All 4 pieces made of polyester and I do not like that for my child.
The latter seasons got a little outside of itself.
My little princess put on their Disney dresses to play this game.
If, like me, you find yourself wondering what makes the big guys in the entertainment industry so big, you've come to the right review.  
I hope your family enjoys it as much as mine has.
Puzzle two has an anchor on the back of each piece and so on.
It was quite OK.
and I'm sure he will be a treasured stuffed animal in our collection.
I ordered for my son this mickey  mouse hand towel.
and he just loves chewing on the thermometer!
seeing this in blu ray you can see all the detail and craftsmanship that Disney brought to all of their movies.
The Anime was as good as I was expecting, and Mr. Belushi shipped it out promptly.
the pieces go together easily and although she  needed some help (she is 2.5 yo) she enjoyed putting it together.
And even better in 3-D. Love watching this over and over again as the special effects are so great.
Never once, after viewing "Cars," did I remember it fondly.
This was a quality product at a great price!
The toys are not super high quality but have not broken.  
While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for  each series on it..... ala volume two.
They love them.
Don't pay more than $7.99 for them (even that's a bit high for what you get), as there are lots for sale at much higher prices.
well made, great size, well worth the money spent.
While the Rangers originally gave Dale a regular undeveloped roll of vacation photos, it gets swapped for real microfilm that is being hunted by rat thugs for their evil scientist boss.  
Compare this to a movie like Tangled where the main characters have fully fleshed out stories and motivations.
i would.but not only would you be buying this for yourself,but you are also buying this for your kids,or grandkids etc.i know watching this movie was a great experience for me when i was little,and i think it will be a great experience for the next generation as well.
They wasted no time creating this masterpiece.  
Bambi is a great movie to watch and gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD FEATURESDisc 1PlayBambi: Inside Walt's Story MeetingScene Selection1)
He is loved everyday.
These are not insignificant qualities for our children to acquire.
Why can't HE have real hair?  
My daughter is two years old and loves this movie.
We enjoyed the story and animations so much we had to purchase this for your grandchildren.
When this set arrived I figured it would be about the same since I think it is from the same manufactuer, but since it had Rapunzel it was sure to be a hit with my daughter who falls asleep to "I Have a Dream" every night. .
Watch it and do not question yourself.
The story is delightful, the graphics and effects are so beautiful and appealing, and the Blu-ray tranfer practically took my breath away.
I am very pleased with this purchase.  
FOR SOME REASON THE OZ AT THE DISNEY STORE DOES NOT COME WITH THE CHINA DOLL BUT OZ IS MORE TRUE TO ACTOR JAMES FRANCO THERE
I never saw it as a kid but was certainly put off when I saw the iconic characters in their actual (animated) performances.
She's strong-willed, independent, and does not let people drag her down.
They arrived in plenty of time to be wrapped and put under the tree for our youngest daughter (she is 5).
The only piece that bugs me is the shark 'Bruce'.  
We only wish the 2nd one and Planes were better.
Makes a great gift.  
I really liked the movie and certainly liked that big baby.
We bought this series at a Cracker Barrel store after we enjoyed a few episodes on TV Land.
The disney film THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD is one in the series of three films the movie is great for kids and adults who like old Disney like I do.
Not only that, but the pull string phrases are loud and clear and are definitely Tom Hanks' lines from the movie isolated for the toy.
I had an old Ipod shuffle that I uploaded a bunch of kids music to, and she loves to listen to it and sing along with it.  (the microphone does get a bit annoying sometimes, though, lol).
Easy to use mold makes great eggs every time with a nice piece of metal that does not leak eggs into the pan.
As you get closer to Phase One you may notice Jack and/or Sydney are going on CIA missions frequently while they're still working with SD6, who throughout season 1 summoned them constantly at all random times, and that pushes my suspension of disbelief a bit- especially upon repeated viewings.
Deleted Scene: "Fathoms Below" Alternate Version* Deleted Scene: Backstage with Sebastian* Deleted Scene: "Poor Unfortunate Souls" Alternate Version* Deleted Scene: Sebastian Lost in the Castle* Deleted Scene: Advice from Sebastian* Deleted Scene:
I was so happy to find Peter Pan on dvd.  
I foresee not issues in the near or distant future, at least no more than any normal 2 year old can muster.  
The pull sting is strong and makes him say lots of things!
Sweet as pie and twice as great. have to love it.
My son did like it
and it was there.  
I love Keira Knightley!
The new cast is just as good as the old one and just as funny.
Would be nice if there would have been music or something.  
The three key elements of Pixar magic are evident in this masterpiece: a great story (essential for any good movie, beautiful, and unique animation and solid character voicing.
When they finally arrive at the art museum for the actual caper, the obligatory slapstick is too late in coming, too rote, and all too brief before the caper is abruptly wrapped up.  
It is also much more shallow than the picture shows.
Perfect series, evolving interesting, action packed!  
The plastic is flimsy and cheap and the key broke in the keyhole before the day's end.  
It trudges along at a pace too slow for my tastes.
If the East India company had been insane enough to exceed their authority by landing troops in other parts of the world, (e.g. Caribbean islands), arresting the King's Governors, suspending civil rights, and conducting mass executions of British subjects, it would have given their many enemies in parliament all the ammunition they needed to close the company down, which is precisely what the House of Commons eventually did do in the 19th century.
Bravo to Paul Attanasio for his exceptional screenplay.
She plays with all of them with the scenes from the movie.
What else i can ask for.
Better yet Michael Keaton as Chic Hicks barely sounds like Michael.
My daughter walked around saying brown bear for days after seeing this movie.
That same scary sequence of various characters being chased by something growling and horrid looking, with sharp teeth, is repeated more than once.  
What a shame.
my son loves them all and has the mickey toon plane, and they all work great in it.
Think Braveheart meets The Mummy.
I would be happy to do business with him again!Thanks
The only complaint I have is that the crown is on a plastic head band that doesn't really fit and hurts my daughters head.

John Denver use to sing the song, "Calypso".
Well packaged and timely delivery.
Start with the acting, much of which is excellent, particularly from Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann, Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, and especially Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.
I yawned, but all that matters is their critique of the movie.
she loves doing her hair, and mommy and daddy's hair, and the dog's hair, and just about anything that will sit still long enough!
D+So that’s only 3 bad episodes out of 24, & a little over 2 thirds of the set are A- or better.  
When is crying over the fallen Beast and the first sparks of magic start to fall from the sky, I was in tears at the beauty (no pun intended) of the momment.  
his right arm moves with a button on his back, and shines a laser beam with a button press.
With so many reviews, just wanted to add my rating the the overall score and note how this was my personal favorite since I have always loved this story and love books.  
Can hardly wait to enjoy watching it with my grandson.
I remember watching Duck Tales while growing up and loved them.  
Sleeping in it meant it needed washing weekly.
Great viewing for children.
well kids will get the message about not being truthful and also about family love..
Clayton is the first Disney villain to die by hanging.
I actually purchased it for my grandchildren and when I called their parents the other night,  I was told that my four-year-old had her parents play it about 25 times in that day alone.  
It's a quality show with a lesson involved.
I was impressed with the quality and features of this Buzz as compared to my expectations.
I purchased it awhile ago because I felt the need to relive this movie experience from when I was a kid and it did not disappoint!
In all probability, Jack is each and every one of us on our worst day and on our worst behavior.  
Each director trying to one-up the other director.  
This was the only Doc McStuffins toy that we could find that had all the characters.
talespin is a great cartoon i loved it as kid its very funny now i am glad i got it
Rushmore isn't loaded with special features, but there is some really great stuff in what is included.
We love it, but need better arrows.
Perfect packaging and sealing.
She felt every emotion and verbalized it loudly.
I LOVE THE BRITISH MOVIES AND OTHER SERIES.
The picture quality on this set is unbeatable and the DVD extras are fantastic.  
Alice's blue dress, the Queen's red and black dress, the artistic backgrounds used throughout the colorful world, everything is full of detail.
CARS is a NASCAR-inspired tale of a world populated strictly by motor vehicles.
Antonio Banderas' best role ever.  
She has short term memory loss, don't pick on her.
My daughter loves him!
Buzz does so many movements and says lots of funny things ... and the wings pop out & he salutes & so many buttons to push & flashing lights, OH MY!
The graphics on the stove door is not -- it's a sticker you have to stick on the block).
Being an aspiring musician myself, I totally relate with this film.
Beauty and the Beast is a film for all ages and although it's only 19 years old, it will be an eternal classic for years to come.
I love disney movies.
Yes, it's a bit sad, in the way so many Disney movies are sad (do I have to spell it out?  LOL).  
I make no accusations against anyone who made this film because I don't know, but the generic plot here (which I've seen oh so many times since) strikes me as having been made by people who don't understand fairy tales and don't want to bother trying--who, to be blunt, are prejudiced against real fairy tales.  
I have never seen a series as good as this one.
Also she's a brunette like me XD.
If their parents are using a DVD player all they have to do is skip to the next chapter as soon as scary stuff comes on.
Great movie for the whole family.
If you kick back and take the sequence of largely disconnected events as they come, it's a lot of fun.
Two thumbs up!!!
but I would also have liked it if she had removable leggings instead of just the painted on ones.  
I liked it very much.
This is the only way to watch Rushmore.
It is just your very plain and basic doll.
I got this from Amazon because I wanted to make sure they (I got 2) were authentic.
Played it the weekend for our grand daughter ans she loves it.
The screenplay for Finding Nemo is very, very clever and its one of those films you can watch multiple times and pick up something new each time.  
Teaches loyalty and trust among friends and family.
I recommend this for older kids at the least.
He loved them,but didn't play much with them.
The great thing is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight.  
They're usually seen in or coming out of this trance.
What more is there to say than the marriage of Disney and Pixar is one of, if not thee greatest partnerships of our time.  
This is finely crafted, well acted, and engaging.
Even I have to admit this set is a really good buy.  
Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this set.  :(
Too hard for my 4 yr old granddaughter & grandson to manipulate, but they had never practiced with a bow & arrow before.
I won't reveal any more of the plot, because it doesn't really matter.
It's finally available!  
She loves Rocket and was so happy to have it.  
Just loved the movie.
I love all Disney videos.  
An interesting fact that I found most insightful was that the former actor who voiced Bambi in the original film later went onto command entire army regiments during his more mature years in adulthood.
This is the original Disney movie that many of us grew up with.  
Two thumps WAY DOWN!!!!!
It's soft and just the right size for my 20 month old.
My friends have been badgering me for years to see "Finding Nemo."
Minnie has some spots on her, doesn't matter to my child but it matters to me since I paid for it....
After so many years of Pixar being in our lives it's difficult to be wowed by their talents anymore.  
I truly believe it is a masterpiece.  
Happy with the purchase.
so I decided to order her this at least she has something until the decide to put the whole series on dvd.
Also, Snow White's foot, after very light play, became separated from the base, but overall this is a fantastic set and I highly recommend it!
Disney's twisted portrayal of true love is mine too!  
My wife and I saw this and it was like watching a movie when I was 10 years old.
First, the movie looks like it was made for blu-ray.  
I was thrilled when we found it here on Amazon for a great price.
Stewart has recently lent his wonderful acting prestige to the new release of "Bambi 2" where he plays Bambi's father.  
What ensues is a hilarious romp for dogs & dog lovers a like, as the Dachshunds lead the Great Dane astray into one messy predicament after another, but always exit before getting caught, leaving, "Brutus," the Great Dane to take the blame.
First one was better (as most are).
but it has a wonderful story and a great family film.
A boy who never wanted to grow up, Neverland and the battle between Peter and Captain Hook is known to Disney fans.  
A little surprised on the quality and expected more, but then this is why ordering on line is not always the best for toys.
Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and may even get some of the other Disney toddler princess dolls.
My kids love this!
Maybe on the next season they will get rid of Sloan.
AT GRANDMA'S HOUSE, HIS MOM HAS TO GO BACK TO GET IT.
The guest stars are great and have a wide range of talents; such as singers, dancers, actors, musicians, comedians and song writers.
I do not remember Tinker Bell being such a brat.
This was an easy buy.
At first she was not too happy about the monsters but once Boo showed up it was all good.
Another object falls and the village is attacked by space aliens.
We've had 2 pairs of tap shoes and ballet shoes in there with a little room left.
You'll know what I mean if you watch it, and you gotta watch it, it's hilarious!Also, Jake is so cute in this.
One Hour in Wonderland - (59:29)
so anyone who is a big fan of kim possible and does not have this movie should buy it and watch it i can really gurantee that you will fall in with the characters and the movie.
My little boy watches it over and over again.  
If a child says that "it's not very pretty," than you know it's not the best.
Love this movie.
After all, if he DID allow Emilio (played by Wade Dominguez) to speak to him, Emilio may not have been killed.  
This is the best episode on the set & my favorite episode of the whole series next to Good Times Bat Times.  
How can they define this film as a "broad comedy" when humans and `raccoons' kill each other just so the filmmakers can make their point about respecting the land and the critters who live there.  
It really does make a difference to have Blu-ray movies.
He seizes Gaston and is about to fling him from the battlements, but his newly-awaken better nature spares Gaston's life - a fourth selfless gesture.  
I know the Black Stallion movies were made several years ago, but don't let that stop anyone from at least purchasing one of the the Black Stallion movies.  
The other issue with Jasmine is that her shoes are literally held on with clear rubber bands which is a choking hazard as are the shoes.
This movie is very sweet and full of lessons for kids.  
I watched it as a child now my kids watch it.
This is typical Disney -- presenting what might make the viewer uncomfortable in an inappropriately comic manner, or ignoring it altogether.
All this aside though, I just found Cars to be very boring.
Outfoxed:  Concerned that Xanatos will sabotage a state-of-the-art flying fortress, Goliath vows to protect it, but is captured by the ship's owner, Cyberbiotics' CEO Halcyon Renard, and his assistant Preston Vogel.  
This pillow is adorable and if it gets dirty I put it in the washing machine to be washed.
I was not very good.
If you have a child that loves to pretend this is the game for them.
This movie could possibly be the best one Pixar has put out there.  
I love the dad.
Scrooge’s Pet:  Scrooge loses the new combination for his vault to a lemming that the boys and Webby got him as a pet.  
Disney Studios 14th full length animated feature film is another fan favorite.
this is truly a classic.
I love this movie!
I have Cars on DVD and almost the cast toys.
So add it to your collection before Disney puts it back in the vaults!
Artwork was up to Disney's top notch quality.
There's even been an X rated version done as a musical (quite good).
And I considered Peter impossibly arrogant; I still do.
This is very cute at first day of opening but don't breath on the arrows....they broke beneath the rubber.  
We go there in our dreams.
If the player is correct he
The entire side of the bottom and half way through the other side was undone, looked like it was never even glued in the first place.
Stumbling into this is Abbot-like sidekick Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a one-eyed butterball who is in love with his "shmoopsey" Celia (Jennifer Tilly).  
But Stempel appears to be unbeatable.
This is probably a film that requires several viewings to fully appreciate.
I really like this movie!  
I'm going to sit this one to the side for a couple of years.
My son has gone to fall over many times in the tub and where he normally would have hit his head in the tub, he bumps softly on these instead.  
"Alice in Wonderland" is no exception.  
But Amazon buyers beware, a lot of the used copies of this being sold on Amazon have the 'proof of purchase' torn out above the bar code on the back of the cover.
Long Way `til Morning:  Hudson is plagued by memories from 984 AD, when Prince Malcolm was poisoned.
For the price, I was expecting the fabric to be stiff and/or scratchy.
All in all it's a good purchase.
It is a great value (morally and financially).  
However, Randall has some dark plans of his own to revolutionize the industry and that includes kidnapping children.
We've had few problems with the seat.
I did not know anything about the cast but sat glued as the script unfolded and moved me along with the trials and challenges being shown.
The film has never looked better, but it is a little light on bonus material, probably due to less material to be found for it.
Brian Dennehey and Charles Martin Smith have always been superb actors, and while Charles Martin Smith was the main star of the film, Brian Dennehey truly "stole the show" with his performances as "Rosey the bush pilot".
He thought she was "boring", and indeed she is because Alice is the STRAIGHTMAN/GIRL!
Lambie stopped talking after only two days!  
They all add to the nostalgic tone and fit perfectly.
I really love this movie one of my favorites when I was little!
I think everyone can relate on this issue.  
Palace Pets make great gifts for any little princess!
I've thought about getting rid of it, but I feel guilty knowing what he paid for it and how little we've used it.
Unknown to them, Clayton has come with a different idea.
"Finding Nemo – A Filmmakers’ Roundtable [18 minutes]
Would recommend for young ones.
They don't come out and hug or say anything obvious...both are reserved in their own way....
Mr Ray's Encyclopedia2012 DVD Bonus Features*
It does what a lot of other action movies fail to do, it entertains.
I am a kid again when I watch it.
Of course there are a couple scenes that are pretty sad - characters die...but that's real life.  
I couldn't finish it.
Thankfully Santa delivered this one.
He played one of the games on this deluxe set too!
So, I bought this doll for her.  
This movie brings back such good memories of our childhood!  
This is one movie that i ordered around Christmas for my awesome grandchildren.  
Even Pooh gives up, singing a song in which he reveals that his heart is about to break.
I got it for my almost-2-year-old brother, and he shows some interest in it.
Its like Finding Nemo.  
Our dvr player died so it was very nice to be able to get it on dvd.  came quickley and was packaged well
Monstro and Stromboli are both terrifying characters and I would imagine would give younger viewers nightmares for weeks!
It's fun to hear Mac talk.  
It has a few expressions (all from the first movie), light-up wing tips, karate chop action, and laser that lights up w/sound effects.  
David Crocket and the Riverboat story is my favorite.
Even the ending is surprisingly quiet and gentle for a Hollywood film.
Also the rug is thin and not soft at all.  
After removing from the packaging completely is when I noticed Pocahontas has movable joints in the ankles, wrists, knees and elbows...a little extreme compared to many other Disney Princess Dolls.  
It's fair but by no means great.
So funny with British sense of humor.
This was a Christmas gift for my grandson, he watches this movie over and over, takes his tractors and tips them over like when Mater and Lightening McQueen make them do in the movie, so that will show you how much kids like this movie.  
With his Cars bed, Cars side rails, Cars pajamas and Cars slippers, this bedding set is a perfect compliment to all the other Disney Cars items we have for our new grandson.
Love the Bluray from these guys.  
Sneak Peeks:Some trailers include:Cars 2 (in theaters June 24)The Lion King: Diamond Edition (on BD and DVD this fall)The Incredibles on BD (already released)Dumbo: 70th Anniversary (on BD and
Great fun and great show ....
Would buy again.
We were getting frustrated with our other baby tub because it was great for newborns with the net and all, but not so great for as they get bigger it was too HARD.
It's cute and has just the right tools.
They are ADORABLE!  
It has a wide appeal and I really enjoyed it.
I have all of the Halloweentown High movies and I absolutely love them.
The movie is still amazing but its missing its original classical feel....
The price was very low so we expected them to be below-average quality but not quite this low.
That may be rose tinted glasses and reminiscing about watching this film as a kid, but it feels right never the less.
While a fantastic film with wonderful direction, writing and excellent performances by Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer, unfortunately 1999 was one a competitive year for American cinema as films such as "American Beauty", "Cider House Rules", "Being John Malkovich", "Magnolia", "The Sixth Sense" and "The Green Mile" were all in the running for various award categories.
My son loves Monster's Inc. and this is a great way to learn the characters and play!
Some of the cartoons on TV right now are not at all in the same league as the clever writing and storytelling found in this series.
Winnie The Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh YearPlayBreak the SpellDisc 2Cogsworth & Lumiere's Library: FOR THE ULTIMATE FILM FANOrigins of Beauty and the BeastDevelopment1.
I got it as a gift to my niece.
Action, faith promoting experiences, healing obedience, love, faithfulness and endurance are all in this movie in a beautiful setting.
Disney, need I say more.  
It's  hilarious and great lines.
I didn't purchase this set from Amazon.
I would have liked to see the fairy godmothers separated, but whatever, she's happy with it.  
It's classic winnie the pooh which makes it even better.
The movie takes a long time to build up in the beginning.  
One of my most favorite animated movies is 'Finding Nemo'.  
And did you ever notice that everything the Queen of Hearts says, is punctuated by a brass section?
My old tape was getting old.
This one was a total loss.
It is also one of the few films that have made me cry.
It's very cute and adorable.
I never get tired of watching it.
As a matter of fact, the only names I remembered without looking up was Cliff Edwards, who plays the lovable (and sometimes feisty) Jiminy Cricket and Mel Blanc whose only contribution is a "hiccup" by Gideon, Foulfellow's sidekick.
But most of all, I was disturbed by the choice to retain Hans Christian Andersen's plot device that makes this little mermaid voiceless — and without following it through to Andersen's moral.
It can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
This was when Keenen was in his hey day.
The 7.1 surround mix breathes new life into a celebrated collection of songs, a beautiful musical score, and lively sound effects.
We'll also be bringing this seat to Italy with us in a couple of months.
Its best to watch it with Disneyview, a way to watch it without those Black Bars on the TV.
It was loaded with deleted scenes, promotional material, audio commentary , deleted songs and demos from Phil Collins.  
"The Spot" was my favorite episode from this DVD.
Devotion to science, is disclosed, when Mr. Smith decides to engage in a nutrition experiment by dining only on mice for (apparently) several months, in order to demonstrate that wolves can survive on mice, and do not need to eat caribou.  
Originally, the 12 ladies in a proper British hamlet posed tastefully au natural for a calendar that was printed to earn money for a reading room in the name of one of the ladies' husbands who had died from cancer.  
That's very true, but there's been a few conversions of 2D to 3D that were amazing.  
Wonderfully made, beautiful pictures, and very educational.
It's a gem.
The positive is that the voice actors do an incredible job.  
No ghosting, and there are a lot of moments, within the film, where rain or different elements project out into the room.  
Chip `n' Dale are becoming more aggressive in their competition for Gadget's affections, and things only get worse when a lab rat named Sparky seems to be beating them both.  
I love the Little Mermaid, but am saddened by the poor attention Disney pays to some blurays.  
I was pleasantly surprised.
I expected this puzzle to be sturdy wood; thick not flimsy.
This is the side that I feel is not as well known as the Miyazaki fantasy side.
Cars is a great animated film and one which doesn't have all of the stuff they stick in the R and PG-13 rated films.  
This is good quality and sturdy and well made.
Disc three starts with Back Out In The Outback where mysterious Whisp creatures in Australia are shaving the sheep as Scrooge and family are visiting a rancher (voiced by Peter Cullen) as they must find the mystery behind the bizarre flying objects.
Pixar has always continually put out a fantastic array of movies for children over the years, but this one stands out amongst the throngs.  
Great movie for you library.  Loved it
It begins at day, innocently enough, and gradually turns to night with Alice alone and lost in the forest.  
it is great for kids and family.  
Since I read about the pieces coming apart, I pulled them apart myself, super glued them back together first thing, and haven't had a problem since then.  
And Then Go Ahead".....a fitting bit of wisdom from the King of the wild frontier.
However, what they ultimately do with it is underwhelming.  
To be fair to our 3 year old, we only have washable crayons and she never drew anywhere near her doll.
The packaging was safe and easy.
Five of the seven look very good with two shorts looking a bit tattered.
I think it's something the animators put together for fun and are sharing with us.
Could an exposé like Wigand's interview even be considered for network TV now -- or would it break on the internet
this toy will always be in the heart of kidsit's huge gift for kidsgreat excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellenthnksarrived on time in perfect conditionsgreat toy
I am really enjoying my movie.
She loved the cake but more importantly, loves playing with these toys still.
There is no way to fit an arm (with a hand) through those holes.  
True, the VHS version of Sing Along Songs: Very Merry Christmas Songs is pure Disney woven classic with no undue narration between musical scenes, unlike the DVD copy with additional Disney scenes I can also appreciate.
and you wonder for a moment if some bizarre purpose behind this statement, the mass executions, or what on earth the East India company is doing in the Caribbean in the first place may be about to be explained.
Strong female lead, action and adventure, an over arcing mystery, and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing.
Nothing here that feels cheap or seems like it will split at the seams.
During the journey Arthur ponders his life more deeply, and wonders what could have been if he would have traveled more with Trillian.  
The fit was perfect and she had room to move in it without a problem.
I'm looking to watching this with our kids some day also.
Trouble is, if things turn sour by Halloween Eve, then Marnie and her entire family stand to lose their magical powers.
even the white lock.
A wonderful family movie, with a fun story and good acting.  
Microducks From Outer Space:  Scrooge misuses an alien size-shifting device, and accidentally ends up shrinking himself, the boys, and Webby.  
Gotta tell due to the amount if features like moving parts can be a little delicate for childs that like to throw toys away ..  so keep that in mind ..  
You technically get a "full screen" , but it's with Disney View.
To me it didn't have much of a Halloween feel to it & I didn't like the fact that they weren't in Halloweentown.
quality blu-ray remastering.
This movie was a sequel to The Misadventures Of Merlin Jones.  
For one, she likes to read.  
Don't pay over $2.99 for it.
It's geared for kids but adults will enjoy it as well.
Mike & Sully must work to return her without getting caught by the authorities.
Spoiler alert:Bambi's mom gets shot.
Great toy for any child to use and play with.  
A good project or any other endeavor that can restore the feeling of winning again is so valid, and often prescribed!  
I loved the books when I was a kid.
We love it and it is the perfect fit for our tub.
The video and audio have been so cleaned up that it looks like it was only released this year except, of course, for the fact that it is not widescreen.
It is very realistic to the character in the film.
I thought my son would be bored to pieces but we loved watching.
We got this for out 5yr old nephew and he loves them.
I sometimes wonder how many times they had to choose between what would be aesthetically pleasing and what would be utmost realism.  
And the score by Paul J. Smith (some parts written by Harline) is an extraordinarily well-written and very underappreciated score.
These movies keep both of us entertained.  
But he really shines as the character he portrays in this film.
Besides being an enjoyable movie on the surface, it's a movie with a message that can teach the value of teamwork vs. trying to go it alone--something all of us need to learn while we are young.
It is delightful entertainment.
I really enjoyed watching the shows.
Where's Finding Nemo 2, Disney?!
The story choices are just mind boggling!
I loved this movie as a child and still as an adult and I have a child of my own and she loves it too alot than a DVD and cannot scratch a vhs
The Norsemen show themselves to be smart, inventive, strong and brave.
I am happy with the size of the rug.
Good Movie for the young at heart.
This is a must for family television night.
In few words...
I love having the DVD and digital copy included so my daughter can watch it anywhere.
The humor is funny.
This clever animated version of the Tarzan story is delightful and can be enjoyed by youngsters and adults.
ORDER CAME IN AWESOME TIMING.
I never ever went to the extremes Max did, in fact, I never acted on my attractions what so ever, but I felt a kind of...
I got it for my 3 year old.
It was a little hard to be sure from the description if this was a DVD or Blu-Ray and it was in fact Blu-Ray.worked just like it was supposed to.
I would highly recommend this to others.
Disney's second full length animated feature film.
I love that you great special features, too!
We love watching this movie at home with the kids.
Princess Enchanted Tales special but if you like the TV series it nice to have a couple of episodes like we got with Tarzan and Jane DVD.
I liked these movies that Disney made at that time.  
we have all watched this movie probably 20 times and thought I'd review is since I own it and have actually watched it.
brings back memories.
If that's all you care about, then you might like these.  
I have seen this story before, and I knew what was going to happen ultimately.
Pillow Pets are super dope.  
He is completely floppy.
great animation as always.
There's a lesson to be learned in true love, and this movie taught it perfectly!PS: I kinda wish Gaston appeared in a Kingdom Hearts game as a boss.
Bought this for my grandchildren who love jake and he never land pirates and they absolutely loved this.  
That was all fine and dandy back in the day, but now that I'm raising my own little girl: honey, stay the *@#$ away from this movie.

Dick Van Dyke is a master of the arts, a wholesome entertainer that we can enjoy as a family.
He says that when Pinocchio grows too old, he will be chopped into firewood.
Friends who have seen it have loved it too.
By now everyone has, or should have, seen Beauty and the Beast, so I won't comment on the film, however the transfer to Blu-Ray is stunning, not only the picture but the sound, the sound is far clearer and has more dynamic range than the DVD, the picture is among the best transfers Disney has done, which means flawless, enjoy.
This is the third dvd I have purchased of this movie since it came out.
One of the redeeming qualities is Mary Blair's conceptual influence on the film.
I'd rather be sure I was right then go ahead, but I have no idea how to be sure about this.
Bullseye is well-made, but he makes no sounds.  
Normally I try to fold the comforter over at the edge to hide them.
Most of the characters were delightful.
Come on, duh."
However, I wanted to write this one to help others in the US avoid any stress in case they decide to buy this Blu Ray version, as it is a UK import.  
Great Story though.
Cute movie but a little too much hype.
While I ordered these NEMO figurines for the grand kids to play with, I ended up leaving them attached to the plastic and putting them on display.
The late Jerry Goldsmith accompanied the action with a stirring score, with an appropriately Wagnerian flavor in the last few scenes of the film.
I can do other things while it is cooking and after 3 minutes it is perfectly cooked and ready to go.
It's entertaining for the whole family so now we have it on DVD! :-)
These are smaller than I expected and cheaply made.  
I recommend this DVD for anyone who likes good, clean movies.  
Pixar's animation captures expressions, realistice movement
When this DVD set came in the mail, my daughter and I immediately sat down and watched the 5 part pilot episode "Treasure of the Golden Suns".
buy this for your children.
I could watch it day after day.  
I loved being able to share this movie with the next generation.
the one where Huey, Dewey & Louie first move in with their uncle Scrooge?
The Disney Store has the Aloha Buzz for $20 right now but normally this Buzz would be $32 (so if your not buying it in 12/2011) then this the same price as the Disney Store!Pro's- He Karate Chop-
I never should have doubted Pixar.
He's a US Marine.
It is hard for me to imagine that I will say anyting which has not already been said about this set in earlier reviews.
PARANORMAN---the son of a fat man is able to see and speak with dead people.
Got this one for my husband like 2 years.
There is also a great look at the early Adventureland entertainment including fire dance.
Alan Menkin's music for the film is wonderful.  
She was absolutely messmerized by Alice and all her friends.
I might suggest a child be at least 7 and maybe even a little older.
Bambi has been a childhood favorite since the 1950s.  
This was a good set to add to my collection.  
While the film looks fantastic, I will keep my previous Platinum edition because once again Disney has omitted some bonus material that should have made the cut, there isn't anything too important missing, but considering this is a short treatment to begin with they should have included all of it.
, she love the music and all the little animals
This can't be said for the general run of Disney animated features which are are alternately cute, frightening or sad.  
And stops it altogether.
Of course, Helen Mirren and Julie Walters in leading roles is a real plus.  (Ms. Walters plays Ron Weasley's mom in the Harry Potter movies.)
Pixar and Disney always have great graphics and color.  
Angry with Amazon for their search process and ticked with the seller or whoever determined the refund process!  
My niece loves Toy Story and got this for Christmas!  
Both of my kids love it.  
Disney has so many classics that at times, it can be difficult to list only one favorite.  
She was 23 when she requested it.  
She likes to pretend the curling iron is scissors some of the time and a curler at other times.
I bought this as a 3rd birthday present for my daughter and she LOVES
Probably my only complaint is that the joints are pretty loose, so it's hard for Buzz to stay standing in an action pose.  
Bought it for my 2 year old daughter who just loves Minnie and Mickey.  
Not the best Ghibli film.
Watching the film again, I found my foot unconsciously waving in the air during "Be Our Guest".
Words cannot describe how much I love this movie.
it's pretty damn cute.
He loves DuckTales and brought them to my house so he could watch them right away.
This is one Awesome movie.
What can be said about "The Little Mermaid" that already hasn't been?
Definitely recommend Amazon Instant Video; who wants a bunch of discs laying around when you can put it on your tablet, phone, or watch straight from your Xbox or TiVo?  
The world consists entirely of personified animals and casting Don Knotts as the jittery turkey mayor, Wallace Shawn as the canine school principle and the duo of Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara as the alien couple proves that Disney's knack for selecting appropriate vocal talent was never in jeopardy.
Audio Commentary hosted by Roy DisneyIV.
The flat sheet is just that though..
It is perfect in its structure without ever being wearisome - entirely predictable in every way yet a delight to see unfold.
My dad has been wanting this movie for a long time and I ended up buying it for him for Christmas in 2010.
I definitely recommend The Little Mermaid to everyone's collection.
The locations, shot in British Columbia, are gorgeous and evocative of a misty, ominous Scandinavian wilderness.
It's nearly a half hour before Pinocchio even leaves Geppetto's workshop but what an amazing workshop it is.
and it is made well.
For the animation enthusiast, this is awesome!*
Enjoy it ever time I see it tho!
I let her know not to chew them but sometimes she does.
She talked to and followed a stranger or a large bunny rabbit (i think?)
Neckless, cheap9.
I have always loved the story of Beauty and the Beast.  
but i stopped useing it because my daughter wouldnt stop standing in it and a few times she did
The characters are different, a son and a daughter instead of 2 girls, the dad is a doctor and he plays a major role.  
Excellent ratio quality - price.
SO HE TAKES IT EVERYWHERE.
Wonderful gift for the kids or grandkids
my husband and i played with it for 20 minutes before we put it away for christmas for our 3 year old.
Naturally, Disney's predilection for killing parents is well represented in this film (along with a quick disposal of a baby gorilla).  
Unlike the regular die-cast cars, these cars are made of plastic so they are not as durable.  
and I laughed my "coconuts" off and sang the theme song when my parents drove me home.  
The only remotely likable character in that film is Gill (the leader of the fish tank) because his plight is totally understandable as well as the reasons why he needed Nemo to sabotage the tank as part of their escape plan (granted, there should be some serious ecological repurcussions for them for doing so, but in a better movie, I'd let it slide).
She had been asking for these dolls for months after watching the movie.
First of all, in the movies the image is improved compared to the television episodes but..I think I prefer the television version, in the movies particularly in ''Davy Crockett: King of the Wild Frontier''
DVD arrived within two days of ordering.
But even with these story gaps, CALENDAR GIRLS succeeds in being charming, flyweight fun from start to finish.  
I remember growing up to TV shows like Recess, and being a kid it was only natural to gravitate to Recess - School's Out when it was released on VHS.
My grandson loves them nevertheless.
I absolutely love this set.
Nuts. !!!  
I like the story line and the acting was great.
You cannot even fast-search through the special features!  
We like having the dvd included because we don't have a blu-ray player in the car, so we can watch it anywhere!
I have learned my lesson and will stick to Melissa and Doug puzzles.
Well worth the $10!
This is an excellent addition to any Disney library.  
I replaced the movie to have for grandchildren.
My 4yr old son and I both like this movie.
She may love the freedom but it made bath time so much harder for me.
and we always watched it when it came on, even though we had all of the VHS tapes too
There is a wealth of extra material for the Disneyphile (I guess I qualify).  
it is made to withstand a 3 year old and looks delicate enough for her to really appreciate the artwork.
Conveniently, Zachary Ittimangnaq drives by on his dog sled, hoists Smith into the sled, and transports him and his supplies to the banks of the lake, and builds him a shelter.  
Now, not to be the bearer of bad news, but this is currently on clearance or sale online at the Disney store for $8.
So I recommend this movie to add to your Baby Einstein collection.
Symbolically, then, here Pinocchio sees the absolute worst side of his most cherished wish.  
It's just a nice, fun flick.  Enjoy.
Pacino was Pacino, Crowe was Crowe, and most of the actors, forgettable.
On the surface we can locate several plausible reasons that explain why Alice in Wonderland resonates with so many.
It is well made and sturdy.
Cars 2, on the other hand, just has so much intellectually and morally wrong with it...and it stars Larry the Cable Guy!
Lot's of shows don't always make it to a second season, much less a 3rd.
This toy is on a bigger scale than the traditional 1:55 scale Cars diecast toys, but it is very well designed.  
I give this film a four of five because in my opinion it needed more fleshing to make five.  
I watched it and loved it.
A great children and early teen movie.  
This was such a terrific movie!Great classic treasure to have.  
This one is witty and it still entertains.
For a CD made of wolf calls from the wild, try Legend of the Wolf on Amazon.
Thus far, the cheaper cars seat has worked and has not leaked - but if I revise this opinion I will be sure to change the review.
If you have read the books, the movie has made some slight changes (Aqua's twin sister Angie is not included in the films, for example).
This is just a good movie to watch over the holiday season, when you're stressed out from all the holiday stuff you need to do.
I remember my kids always loved getting the Disney movies for gifts.
Within 2-3 washes the sleeping bag began falling apart.
The item shipped quickly and if you like the movie you'll love it in 3d.
This is one movie I get out alot and watch and never get tired of it.
My grandchildren are now happily enjoying this classic, and I am rediscovering the magic all over again!
I even tried to find a similar butterfly pattern to match my youngest theme room.  
There's really not much to say about this item.
Picture & AudioLike with every Pixar film on BD, it's not surprinsing that Monsters, Inc. debuts on HD with a completely mesmerizing transfer.
Great for laughs especially if you've read the book or watched the series (TV).
Now if you don't know, Fun and Fancy Free is basically a collection of cartoons and not a full feature like Dumbo or Snow White.
I strongly recommend the purchase of this Disney Christmas DVD.
What an anticlimactic scene.  
This and Beast Wars Transformers were epic cartoons and even years later, they still hold up to form.  
I've been told by other people that Disney did it to shorten the film because it was too long.
Its cute,funny, exiting, action packed and thrilling-for all ages!This is a totally terrific movie!
Thank Disney for putting your classics out on Blu-Ray.
I usually only rate a movie 5 stars if I'm willing to spend the money to buy the DVD so that I can watch the movie over and over again.  
There are rare exceptions though when a film is just okay and not, in my opinion, endowed with much "Disney Magic".
A few featurettes entitled "Art Review," "Bear Legends," and "Making Noise: The Art of Foley" are here also.
Emotionally strong and wise, Wendy Darling is one of Disney's best female animated characters.
The first part of the movie is relatively serious but once Kanai turns into a bear the film takes an abrupt turn becoming a silly animal film.
Lots of humor, especially from the lines that the narrator speaks.
A great battle scene.
Can't beat a Disney movie!  
However, my Grandson had only seen the Movies and he had a funny look on his face when this cartoon started and it didn't hold his interest very long.
That said, it deserves a place in your library if you have young children.
And you thought your family had problems!Sydney Bristow (Jennifer Garner) is a double agent working for the CIA as a mole in the terrorist organization SD-6 which passes itself off as an authentic CIA division to its deceived agents.
It's a wonderful animated film and is suitable for all ages.
It brings their world to life.
You will choke.
Things start looking up when he saves the life of Michael Rennie's legendary climber, who's planning his own assault on the Citadel, but none of the town's guides will go with him...
He refers to her as lucky that he has decided to make her his wife.
Finally, Finding Nemo is many a PIXAR fan's favourite studio animation, and rightfully so.
And you can't talk about a film like this and not mention the score and music that goes with it.
The kids all loved them!  
love these old cartoons, they still make me laugh.
I ended up taking it from her, going to the kitchen sink, and then rubbing the pants continuously to get off as much as I could.  
Big name stars voice these monsters.  
However, they are attacked by a leopard, and the husband and wife are killed.
The audio /video quality is top notch however because hdtv is 16x9 disney started including black border art that matches the scene from the window so it looks widescreen not fullscreen and because the tile art looks like the blu ray i expected that at least the HD edition would include the border art so while everything else is great i can only give 4 out of 5 stars.
As a mom of a 4.5 year old girl I wanted it, but also for myself as it's a great movie.  
Also the suction cup broke off after repeated use but that's not too big of deal.
all kids love this classic story.
I wanted to be able to fold it up and pack it in my luggage, and figured even if it didn't hold up, it was only $10.
I was born in 82 and I don't ever remember watching the movie so now that I have a 3 year old I took the chance.
A very imaginative concept for a story.  
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies are always fun and exciting, it has great actors in it and never ending excitment, such fun
That and Alan Young, the voice of Scrooge McDuck.  
The packaging was beat up though which could've been a result of the apo handlers so I didn't factor that in this review.
Adventures happen along the way and as usual all is well in the end.
wish they had a few more phrases.
Durability is pretty good, it's been dropped a few times (~20" onto tile floor), and everything still works.  
Can't go wrong.
We bought this for one of my son's friends for her third birthday.  
We will still watch the beginning and middle, but save the end for when they are older.
That is actually what the pirates called themselves) so that they can go to war with Davy Jones and get the heart in the box and stab it so Jones will finally die.
He's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween.  
This is a perfect Christmas gift for all family.
but it is just not the best.
My son wanted this for Christmas and has loved it.  
This little independent gem was more than likely your introduction to both director and Houston native Wes Anderson and actor Jason Schwartzman and what an introduction it would turn out to be.
At the end of the movie Faline has twins and Bambi is standing next to his father overlooking the forest.
That's what cowboys did back then.  
I hated this dvd.
Very impressed its very soft and durable.
You can see that this movie was the testing ground for "Snow White" and "Bambi" in how the animators worked to capture natural movement and nature, as well as the initial use of the multiplane camera.
I should just buy it.
His confession to a Congressional panel of being fed the answers to show questions disrupted his life.
Apparently, the region 2 and region 1 versions are different.  
no problems with the "neck" as in other reviews.
great story for all ages.  
Love our time watching & our time pretending afterwards!
Now she has "Jingle Bells" & "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" "down pat"
The Sins of the Fathers Chapter XII "The Spot"The Sins of the Fathers Chapter XII "Goblin War"The sins of the Fathers Chapter XIV
And it Seems durable.5 stars.
On its own it is a good film to take your children to, but by Pixar standards I find the film to very average.  
And they are different than his older brother's extensive collection of cars and trucks.
I loved the story of Alice from the first time I read it as a child.  
My Grandson loves it.
I bought two of these for my grand daughters, 3 & 4, they love them.
OUr daughter love her bag!
Tarzan was in the USA and driving cars before the end of "Tarzan of the Apes".
This is a classic that I am so glad we purchased.  
Making Noise: The Art of Foley- Art ReviewBrother Bear 2 (2006)Disney Blu-ray & DVD (March 12, 2013)Directed by Benjamin GluckThe Voices of Patrick Dempsey, Jeremy Suarez, Rick Moranis, Dave Thomas, Andrea Martin, Catherine O'Hara, Mandy Moore, Michael Clarke Duncan, Wendy Malick, Kathy NajimyMusic Score by Dave MetzgerSongs by Melissa Etheridge, Matthew Gerrard and Robbie NevilThe sequel to Brother Bear falls between  "what were they thinking" and "that was better than I expected.
It's delightfully surreal and whimsical, and it's filled with fun characters and memorable scenes.  
The only thing this movie had in common with the book (or the old text-based interactive video game) was the title and the names of a few characters.  
And there's no possible way I can side with his father, Marlon either because the guy is portrayed as being so anal retentive that he became both annoying and unbearable.
I gave it 5 stars.
I have never seen this movie til recently w/ my son.
There's just something magical about her loving a guy before he even has to talk to her.  
Boy saves village.
Got this for my 5 year old grand daughter who is WAY into Toy Story, to go along with the Buzz and Woody 16" characters we were able to purchase locally.  
If you have spent any time on hwy 40 and rt 66, this movie will have meaning for you.
Anyway after he did something (i have no clue what) with a tiny piece of cardboard he got it working but you can only pull the cord about 1/4 an inch to get Woody to talk now and the string does not retract.
and it comes with a light yellow colored heel and the dress is very sparkly and the only details are the extra detail on the dress and the jewel on her chest of the dress the hair is black and is normal nothing muck overall it is very coll
Very pretty and beautifully made.
I haven't checked out the special features, but it's wonderful to have it in the movie library!
Everyone in the family could relate in some way to the characters on the show and we still use many of the catchphrases in our family today ("I don't think so Tim", "More Power!", etc.).
The animation is amazing (again XD) and the music is very beautiful.
I got this for my boyfriend for our 2 year anniversary because this is his favorite childhood movie, and the reaction on his face was priceless, he looked like a child again.
We understand how, in all the bizarreness of the wonderlands we fall into at night, that we rarely lose our heads.
This time around in fantastic 3D, where the ocean comes alive, the visuals pop and the fish emote, and that's only in the beginning.
I recommend it to other grandparents.
If you love mountain climbing and beautiful scenery then check this delight out.
Just great all around, until the last season and a half... then gets kind of dumb.  
The only downfalls I have are that the front area where the soap holder is, is too wide to fit over the standard faucet to fill, and it you try to turn it around the monkey head rest takes up too much room to fill from the back.
Watching this movie, was like watching it in the theater.  
Very good for bath time reenactment of mermaid life.
But still it has a good story and you will enjoy it.
Toe Mater is a favorite.
For those who have not owned the Little Mermaid in disc format, this is a worthy purchase.
For me that film is Beauty and the Beast.
Something that I have enjoyed since I first saw it.  
Every little boy should grow up on these.
It's so much fun to watch it.
The colors, songs, memorable creatures and fast pace will hold the attention of most children.
You wouldthink I would just go out and buy it, but it is much faster to just rent with a click - lol.
This was a fun easter present for my 5 year old who enjoys Doc McStuffins.
I have no complaints about this.  
But now to the subject at hand.
Alias is keeps the pace of its interwoven story threads moving very tightly in its first season, and in its second season it takes a few breaths only to set up the next run.
In the beginning, it will show the original movie with  horizontal and vertical bars (to preserve the 1.85:1 aspect ratio), but only to give way to the wider 2.35:1 ratio after Kinai is transform into a bear,with brighter and crispier colors; the second movie doesn't have this effect.
Alice In Wonderland is my personal favorite Walt Disney movie ever.
It is so beautiful and very touching story, a really good story that has important morals.
I've been a Peter Pan fan since childhood.
She needed Poppee near her til  it was over.
I have actually followed along on studies that set out to prove that in each other's absence, each of the title clown fish discover the missing element of their relationship: Marlin finds himself befriending a creature (Dory) who proves that survival is possible in the rough and tumble ocean without short term memory or even much common sense while the captive Nemo finds himself under the tutelage of a father figure (Gill) who finds no fault in continually putting Nemo in harm's way.  
The hair straightener and curling iron are so fun and the brush and blow dryer are all substantial weight and good sizes for 3+ toddlers.
This film still looks incredible and it looks wonderful in HD.  
The music was great, glad they didn't burst out singing randomly, because admit its weird.
When she arrives to Genovia they find out that some outdated law states that Mia has to marry before she can take up the throne (Spoiler Alert: If you read the books you would have known tha the history of Genovia started when a woman strangled an evil military ruler with her own braid and the head of Italy or France gave her a small piece of land that she could rule on her own as Princess and she was single when she became Princess, a rule like that in a country like Genovia was just silly).
She said, I LOVE bow and arrows.  :-)
This is a great episode that shows a good side to J. Jonah Jameson.  
Great movie for all ages
My nephew was wanting  this for a long time and his mom
I was lucky enough to have purchased ours at BJ's Wholesale when they were on sale for $5.00 each, and as a parent I don't think they are worth much more than that!
Beautifully remastered and the 3D put a major boost in the likings, brought back some memories.
This movie is definitely a classic.  
Definitely do not have any complaints.
There are teachable moments also, the mommy disappears in the beginning, trusting friends with Dory the silly fish , listening to your father when Nemo is taken from his home.
It's just regular figures (NOT color changers), but they are sturdy and you get a good product for the price.
It's a tribute of the history of the automobile, a nod to NASCAR and its roots, and a love letter to Route 66.
She loved it!
They are so pretty its hard to give them to my daughter to play with They would look great on a shelf in the box as display
Considering that `Toy Story' was released when I was ten, it was an instant hit with me at the time.  
The idea of the earth being a computer might seem a little far fetch and there little mice running the place, but according to science we can do computing in DNA and store Tera bytes of data in DNA as well, so we could be all a part of big experiment.
There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series.
We have written a separate email asking for help.  
Audio literally envelops the soundscape with immersive audio coming from the front and center channels, the surround channels, the rear surround channels.  
The special effects end nicely, but watching Adam grow was messy and it was obvious that they struggled with adding realism to this concept (the disconnect between obvious green screens was bothersome).Overall this was just rather dull for me, but my kids thought it was hilarious.
My 4 year olds love it.  
My 3 year old son loves Tarzan.  
The story is a TOTAL CLASSIC, with the usual high quality from DISNEY...
It has a simple, large pattern making it achievable for youngsters.
Liked what I got but was disapointed that it wasn't the whole set, are they available and how do I get them
First of all, I'm not really sure what is going on with the one star reviews for this doll since the same 3 one star reviews appear for just about every Rapnunzel doll out there.
Nice little figurines.  
It was my second or third time watching it!
With so many other assaults on dads, this was a refreshing change.
I received the new one a few days later and it worked just fine.
My daughter has been sleeping with them every night and carrying them around everywhere she goes!  
As you can probably guess, we were very excited when we heard that they were re-releasing Peter Pan from their vault.
Grandson wanted a new one .He loves Woody.
Chances are, most of you have seen this movie already and if you haven't - grab this DVD, you will not be disappointed.
So glad it is finally available on blu-ray!  
The covered semi was a higher quality product, with thicker and more finished looking plastic.  
Deleted Materials includes 21 minutes of footage that didn't make it into the film.
I can't believe I didn't watch this show when it was on TV!
I was on the verge of returning it...then I thought about inflating it manually like I would with a balloon.
My tub is kind of on the narrow side, but this bath fits in it snuggly and won't slip around.  
Then they awaken, & befriend detective Elisa Maza & make enemies out of the rich man Xanatos & the evil she-gargoyle Demona.  
She especially loves the bounce song and actually bounces along to the song.  
i rember watching this when i grew up in the 90s.
I was not aware of the books.
very happy with purchase, fast shipping.
We can't wait for Cars 2 to be out at the theater!
Was a little confused as to why they were no Disney rewards paper inside since it was a new item it was sealed but no papers were inside I did watch it and it's fine I will use this seller again
highly recommend - it is exactly what you see.
I can't wait to watch him watch it!!!!
It reminds me of Amelie and some of Jeunet's other work in that regard.
This show is one of the funniest I have ever seen..
Ariel is intrigued by what goes on above water, and longs to be human.
liked  THE DVD THE WAY TO GO
Tangled is a favorite of our daughter and this and the newly released "Frozen" are on the frequently played rotation in our house.
don't know what to tell ya.
She talks, and has that adorable Lambie voice and is big enough to cuddle back!
He was looking at the new blankets when he first saw them and pointing to the cars.
Definitely a Disney classic that I would love to watch again soon!
There's a ton of special features including a making of documentary, audio commentary, interviews, audition footage, storyboards, trailer, collectable poster, and more.
I put this in last night for my granddaughter and the adults in the room were just as enthralled.
My girls love puzzles so I thought this would be perfect for them and it is!!!
Rented this for our grandkids and it was a hit.
Just a but too expensive for a child's toy.
This toy is what you would expect it to be in the movie Toy Story.  
It is truly a Disney classic.
A definite add to your collection.
My situation is a bit different from the other reviews.  
A little on the dimwitted side but very funny and always great for a laugh!!!!
I bought these to go with the Doug and Melissa princess castle for my granddaughters this Christmas.  
It is like being in on story development meetings.
With impeccably comedic timing, superb animation and an excellent story, this is another proud addition to the Pixar catalogue and should be a proud addition to your library.
She carries her around with her a lot, even for car rides.
She still likes playing with the plastic jewelry, but isn't interested in playing the actual game anymore.
I watched "Never Cry Wolf" on my laptop the other night
One of the very best comedy sitcoms.
i always have this on in my son's shower/bathtub.
This is a wonderful feature and has saved me a lot of hassle when my child mixes up all the pieces.
I don't particularly care for that much plastic on a vehicle that's supposed to be metal, but since we've owned our Red for almost two years, and it's still in excellent condition--except for a few minor surface scratches--I can't rate down for that.  
We reecently just bought this in bluray, and it looks great on the TV.
Leader of the Pack:  Dingo, led by a new Pack member named Coyote, powered by a cybernetic suit of armor break Jackal, Hyena and Wolf out of jail.  
THIS LOVELY MOVIE FITS THE BILL.
This show is awesome.
My favorite thing was the usage of Japanese mythology and culture within the film - it was lovely.
But they provided a good service as little olive pickers and finally the town grew to love and appreciate them.
Salvador Dali praised Disney as America's only real surrealist, and the surrealism is adeptly employed in this wonderful film.
Buying all the classic DISNEY films on BLU RAY!  
With great animation, a great story with humor and heart, a timeless message, fantastic songs and score and an outstanding array of characters, this film became an instant masterpiece and no Disney film (and many others) has ever topped it.
You will be having to help to dress dolls all the time!
Now i am happy to hare it with my girls (ages 5 and 7) they love it too
We bought this for our granddaughter when she was less than a yr old and it really kept her attn.
It's one of my favorites.
Good plot development to keep things moving along.  
Not wanting to live without him, Dr. Lopez throws herself in his arms, thus sharing his doom.
So glad these came back for DVD.
Great set to get this movie in every format, and the music is wonderful.
"Fish are friends, not food."
I remember this was the first movie I bought with my own money (on VHS!)
but I guess that was the point of the character in general.
We use it during family time.  
Eloise learns that Rachel (Sara Topham) who is the daughter of Plaza owner, Mr. Peabody (Victor Young) is about to marry Brooks Oliver (Rick Roberts).
The company clearly tried to cut costs by using slightly less fabric than they should have.
Peter's companion sprite Tinkerbell is also meticulously drawn and animated, and has garnered her own place in Disney lore.  
It's almost like they were afraid to really develop the characters for being accused of having a movie that drags.  
so we went with this one and glad we did...
Even though elements of earlier Disney heroines were referenced (including Alice), no previous Disney animated lady ever had the range of expression as Ariel, thanks in no small part to the live modeling done by Sherri Stoner, who you can see in the best of the numerous bonus features, "Under the Scene: The Art of Live Action Reference."
The second DVD has the 1962 "Disneyland After Dark" show that gives viewers a beautiful look at what the park looks like at night.  
i wuz thinkin walkin in duh moviez.
It's just a cardboard box that we eventually threw in the trash.  
Love it!!
he's so obssessed with CG animation
Either way, this 2-DVD set is a must have if you grew up watching "The Wonderful World of Disney" or saw the films on THE DISNEY CHANNEL.DVD #1: "DAVY CROCKETT--KING OF THE WILD FRONTIER" goes through the adventures of Davy (and Georgie) as they confront grizzly bears, redskins, congress, and join the small force of soldiers and volunteers at The Alamo.  
The whole series was actually based on an amusement park ride, so I guess the very idea that there are so many films from it is a bit telling, but it is fun and we wanted the whole series.  
I'm told a DVD version coming in April but why do we have to wait?Also - VERY important for anyone reading reviews on this Amazon link.
She sleep on the pillow with bankies on top of her.  
(USA, 2003, color, 100 min plus additional materials)  Reviewed on December 10, 2012 by Eric Gonzales for Disney Blu-ray
There is also an annoying strobe like problem, when the action seems to be going fast.
The Rangers soon find the bees in the control of an exterminator with dreams of being a female rock star with a Queen Bee theme.  
Kids and adults alike love the plot because it's very inventive.
The 'Human Again' song was great, and added a little bit to our desire to know a little more about the stories of many of the supporting characters.
This was definitely one. 80s kid for sure.
I rented the movie having only read a brief synopsis of the plot and was not really prepared for the powerhouse of a story this movie delivers.
And the animation is a disney classic.
so far i have watch it three times i should just buy it then i will have it to watch when i wont
Her father is an inventor, and when he manages to make his new machine work, he sets off to a fair, only to get lost and become attacked by wolves.
I think this would be a good first Buzz for a very young child.  
This movie will stay with you long after it has ended.
The only thing I pan about this movie is Stromboli and the Coachman.
That's my reason for 4 stars.
Julia Sweeney from Saturday Night Live plays a neighbor.
The story is simple, when the husband of one of the members develops cancer, she discovers how horrible the furniture is in the waiting room.
It can't handle everyday use if you watch them frequently.
My kid loves disney and I usually ignore poor reviews as I figure (correctly usually) that most people just don't assemble things properly or have patience to figure stuff out.
When we went and saw Second Screen Live to test out the App she knew all the songs and trivia.
I prefer quirky movies as fork paired to more serious movies.
This has been a new and great experience for me.
If you get excited over cartoons in hi-def as I do, I'm sure you'll be pleased with this Blu-ray presentation of one of the finest Disney films.
I bought this for my daughter when she was about 12 months or so.
so the stuff doesn't come out is blue beads for the "water" and tons of little thing that you will have to find.
They are all on a base allowing them to stand up.  
No more scratched discs from the kids loading and unloading the dvd players.
Usually love these sets because they provide all of the characters.
I was so looking forward to watching this one and it was defective.  
The last new feature is "Disney Intermission", this means that when you hit the "pause" button you get to hear facts about the film.
My son loves  it still, so I would say I made a great desision in buying this for him.
Great fun!!!
My daughter loves this little Lambie.
* Deleted Scenes -
It stars a man --- Ed Asner --- that was PERFECT for the part.
So happy I found this movie,  and that my son will get to enjoy this classic time and again!Thank you.
Not to mention that there so many classics to choose from.
But that's only the framework for a fascinating look at this young misfit who is nevertheless deeply engaged in his school, Rushmore, as an awkward leader who seems to be wearing two left shoes at all times.
It is a small little Lambie, but still very cute and well made.
It's a charming, warm and memorable way to get to know the families and lives of these great artists in a very human way, thanks to Ted Thomas, son of animator Frank Thomas.
This is a THEME DVD intended for CHILDREN focused on what makes a gift special and I feel it accomplishes this task.
In this Oscar season for Toy Story 3, it is well to remember that Beauty and the Beast (as is repeatedly mentioned in the extra features) was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (and it won the Golden Globe for musical/comedy).  
They look so much more attractive than plastic.
You have been warned.
So if you happen to know of a desert island with reliable electric power and a DVD/TV set up, get in touch ...
The only reason it lost a star is because they don't stay very well on carpet unless they have a stand on the bottom like Pete and Clarabelle have.
The doll is cute and perfect for my daughter.
Geoffrey Rush's seagull, Nigel, plays an unlikely role in the effort to reunite father and son.
However, both editions have the same content: Two BDs and 1 DVD.
They worked great, especially because there were 7 princesses!  
The only thing I would change would be to add more arrows to her quiver!
Song of the Night'n'Dale - The Rangers end up in China where they find an Emperor whose sister is going to elaborate methods to convince him that he is crazy.  
We love that my daughter likes it, and it matches the princess inflating tub we got her perfectly!
So I wrote these for my blog originally, but I decided to put them up here as well.
This is one in a series of posted reviews for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon.
We hope this provides you with the information you require.
Apart from how easily Fat Cat fooled the humans, this was a really good episode.  
(He wanted me to turn it off at one point.)  
Great closeness and interaction of all the cast, especially Tim and Jill.
As a husband and father, I felt the pain and doubt that Dr. Wigand must have felt as he faced the heavy decisions he was required to make.
They don't stick at all though and it is not big so it doesn't take up too much room.  
story about how route 66 lost its fame when they built the new super highway .
This section keeps track of everything that has been watched as well.  
Her plush comes out really really easily.  
And scenes like the shark chase just don't explode with 3D effect.  
Probably the greatest commercial animated film done by Walt Disney's amazing crew of animators in the "glory" years.  
Very few guns and blood.
They announced that this is the #1 girls christmas gift this year.
I think it's a dud.  
The extravagant animation and motion, compounded by complicated dialogues, compounded by bizarre characterization of cars as humans; using bathrooms, having emotions, and making plots, all made sitting and watching a mad theater screen any thing but entertaining.
It was very imaginative and creative, with a great ending.
Haven't had a chance to watch yet as we left town just after it came.
When my mother went on a cruise at the end of last year, she picked up a similar set but they had cruise outfits on and it had a cruise ship with it.
Love the movies and this toy!
Once again, Disney has produced a true classic.
To get more ideas, visit my Return to Neverland Pinterest board!
He matches very well and every one alwAys compliments on him.
At first I didn't want to watch this movie because the topic of monsters didn't really speak to me.
We greatly enjoyed watching this charming movie again and had no trouble at all with the previously watched DVD.
He's a good snowman and hasn't melted yet.
All of the "good guys" fit, but Mr. Smee, Captain Hook, and Tic Toc Croc (I think that is his name)... had to go on the side.
Have you seen the remakes of once great old movies remade that come out of Hollywood these day's?Also, how could you replace this cast, it would be like replacing the cast of Jaws just because that shark looks so damn stupid now.
Disney spares no expense giving fans the best high-definition transfer it can for "The Little Mermaid" Diamond Edition.
Needed for the part where Nemo is in the fish tank and faces the guys in the tiki masks -
I still can't figure out where Disney gets it's fleecing, I mean pricing scheme from.
this is truely a disney classic.
This doll is so beautiful I purchased 3 of them.
We had to return this as soon as we saw it and were disappointed that the size of the CDs wasn't mentioned in the description.  
Grand Daughter loves this Jake and the Never Land Pirates 7 pc play set.
A lot of movies called 'classic' don't deserve that appellation, but this one does.
I highly recommend seeing this in 3D.
This is not a historically acurate movie.
My son kept talking about how much he liked this movie, so we had to buy it.  
When you watch this movie, you'll laugh...and be drawn in by the wonderful animation.
All in all, I think it's a really cute movie!!!
Davy Crockett is a genuine myth from a genuine people, and these two movies are produced by Walt Disney, a genuine creator of first rate American cultural artifacts.
GPS Ang Poon Kahdirector 'lou ye' - Ang Poon Kah for film summer palace.
While the plot is more shallow than the first, the twist is equally as predictable.
Very cute mat, but VERY short.  
Love the story and it's even better in 3D. Wonderful graphics and color!
The Mickey's come out perfectly!
That is really no big deal.
How can you have a 'Cars' collection without this one.
they were for a short amount of time before the little mermaid went back into the vault.  
The dogs are adorable.
With the kind of story that they tell, I feel they could easily tell it in 20-25 minutes.
It's something you really have to see, words don't do it justice.
The squirrels and bunnies are all adorable and Kanai comes across a sassy little bear cub Koda.
The third key is Belle herself - she is a true hero and makes her own happy ending.  
When many of today's movies are violent and lacking, and since there's not much for families to watch together anymore, This one will do.
I watched the River Boat Pirates and liked it again like I did when I saw years ago on a Sunday night.
By the way, I don't recommend the action that makes up the title of the review- that's only what I decided to do.  
Getting this replacement was fantastic.  
The Pound of the Baskervilles: To help a dog and his owner regain their rightful ownership to a vast family estate, the Rescue Rangers consult the books of Chip's own hero, Sureluck Jones, for help in finding the will and chasing off the greedy brother that has taken control.  
Do yourself a favor--purchase this movie and let loose with the laughter and the tears.  
My daughter is enjoying them and I'm still happy I purchased the item
But "Alice in Wonderland" did find new life and that was during the late '60s as drugged out college students loved films that were trippy and cool and eventually along with "Fantasia" and "The Three Caballeros", "Alice in Wonderland" became popular.  
I was entertained for it's 102 minutes.  
This got played with for 10-15 minutes before it was tossed aside.
It has its moments, my favorite being the battle with the potions at the end, but there are too many moments where the characters should have realized something was up.  
We enjoyed this movie when we first saw it, had to buy the 3D version when we got a nice 3D TV.  
The seat was inexpensive and we've had few problems.
Don't try to puncture anything.
My grandchildren never tire of this one.
Please buy and share with your children!
so I had to look for something more comfortable at 7 months.
I have watched it over and over.
I don't recall ordering it.  
Entertaining and funny.
This is the first and only animated Disney where a non villain is killed in the movie.
This is one of the best Disney movies I have seen, and it holds a special place in my heart because it was my brother's favorite movie.
Get this show if you remeber it from the 90's.  
At least when the movie reaches an international audience.  
So I do like they did some of the dolls with the both of the outfits.
The Dazzling Princess Game is loads of fun for Disney princess lovers.
but since she loves animals, she had to have her favorite princesses dogs and cats, great toy for little girls :)
But, as one of the animators said, explaining the lack of quality of this film, there were "too many cooks in the kitchen" (the movie had 5 directors).
I needed something for the kids bathroom that was tough, fun, and washable.
"My favorite scene in the movie is "Twitterpated."  
Great for all ages and fun for the family.
Entertaining, exciting and so much fun.
Ditto for Season 3 and beyond.
These five episodes are contained on one DVD along with two episodes from the original 1967 animated TV series.
He's pretty darn cute, but still smaller than I thought- which isn't a problem.
What a great movie, it took someone with a wondr full sense of humor to think this one up.
I'm not saying that is a bad thing... just not what I was expecting from a Disney toy.  
He loves it anyway.
After Season 2, the plots get a little too stale or a little too convoluted.
I have Snow White, Fantasia, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, etc. and every time the phenomenal restorations blow my mind.  
Even mom and dad enjoy this movie!
It came on time and we watched it right away.
Body is thinner, skinner and made of different plastic that does not feel or act as it should.
but this was beyond my control.
Probably a combination of the following two developed my distaste for it: the uninteresting angle of the story and Russell Crowe.
What a shame!
The buttons were not very intuitive for small children and the operation to open the device is a bit difficult for small children to use.  
The skirts are ok - elastic topped so easy to change into and out of independently.
This was definitely worth purchasing.
Please bring it back!!!  
The video quality has been further restored compared to the 2006 platinum DVD copy we own and the 7.1 speaker support is another welcome feature.
It is a great spy thriller with lots of twists that are unexpected.
We have all 3 Volumes and they are a classic that all kids need.
Meanwhile, a mysterious man named El Capitán busts the Beagle Boys out of jail in order for them to help him steal an awkward treasure map in Scrooge's possession.  
The film is true to the stories and the animation is well-done.  
The color quality was great.  
I would recommend this movie to anyone's movie collection.
A excellent family movies.
Some may even find the bonus features "useful" which are described elsewhere in these reviews.
so i contacted the maker of it and they sent us a new stethoscope immediately..WONDERFUL customer service.
A few weeks after that an arm snapped off.
If your little one's enjoy the movie "CARS" & you buy the cars from the movie Sally is a MUST HAVE!  
Don't get me wrong I loved the Lion King in 3D to, and it is also beautiful especially on my 51 inch 1080p tv.
It's not quite the style I was expecting, it's really a documentary kind of movie.
Based on a story by Farley Mowat, one who has said that he doesn't let fact get in the way of the truth.  
it is a good movie
The film focuses on Tarzan growing up, how he relates to the apes and an elephant, and how he tries constantly to win over his ape mother's husband's affection.
Thumper is adorable and cute in teaching Bambi the ways of young fawn to adulthood.
Very nice quality and great for hours and hours of play!
I think I'll go watch it right now!
And, if I need to do something in the house - I know that she's safe watching the movie because the content is appropriate for her!
He is always taking the Iron Vulture out to plunder planes, especially if they belong to Shere Khan.
Movie arrived pretty quickly.
i  loove  this  toy.
I have the original BBC Mini-Series.
Eloise recongizes this, and hopes to take the wedding into her own hands.
I don't like the message it sends to little girls that if u like a boy and he's mean to u, just stick it out and maybe eventually he'll like u back.
There are three of them and we watch them all the time.  
After checking out Cars last night, I'll amend what I said about Cars 2 being as good and admit that Cars had a more focused storyline and was also a little funnier.
Just look at the Beast's fur; it's nowhere near the shade of brown it should be, but much lighter.
I have to give Disney and PIXAR credit for giving our children some truly beautiful movies.
This is probably one of my least favorite Disney movies.
let me just tell you you will not be mat with this movie.
Yes, the impeccable artistes at Pixar of course created a masterpiece with this one.
Very few other Disney movies compare.
We also ordered the Clubhouse, and wanted Pete the Cat and Clarabelle to complete their collection.
The only flaw that I hate about Disney movies is that god damn Disney vault that makes me feel like I have to buy or I won't be able to get it again for 10 years.
The amulet is really big, just like Sofia's, but that makes a little bit heavy for the clasp, and when a rambunctious three year old starts jumping around, it sometimes falls off.
They're bored out of their wits, but remain out of loyalty to each other and promises made to their mothers.
Totally unprepared for the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, their friendship is put to the test as the strain over their personal lives takes its toll.
I wish they would make one that would stand but regardless it is good quality and the child who recieved it loved it.
Guess who gets to be the Thirteenth Warrior" to go?Yes,there are some grisly scenes involved.
Its a shame and she is now unplayed with because she looked terrible.
Small pieces, just like the landing gear, that is about one fall away from breaking.
Yes, I know this wasn't the "average" review, but I wanted to say WHY this film is so important to me, and why, after seeing it about ten times since, and about a year and half since I FIRST saw it, it still packs an emotional punch at the end when the curtains are drawn.
This is definitely a worthwhile buy whether you're a Disney collector or just an animation enthusiast.
The Beast wrathfully imprisons the inventor Maurice merely for seeking shelter without permission in his rococo, gloomy castle.  
The movie is buoyed by villains who are unquestionably slippery and evil.  
I have watched this movie more than a dozen times and still find myself excited as the battles begin, and wishing that it could be longer just so that I could spend more time with the characters.
I mean kids shouldn't be couch potatoes but
Thank you and I am happy.
Koda's Outtakes- Rutt & Tukes Commentary-
She is a faithful watcher of Doc McStuffins and takes good care of all her stuffed animals and dolls as she pretends to be the "Doc".
"Operation Wonderland" is a fascinating vintage promotional featurette that takes a behind-the-scenes look at the making of "Alice in Wonderland" at the Disney animation studio.  
It's a disney movie but great for adults too that don't like gore just good clean fun and scary
It is one of my favorite classic Disney films.
One of my favorites.
this blu ray set is well worth buying if your like me and prefer the best picture and sound with a side dish of extra's with your Beauty And The Beast.
The picture and sound are good, but the story was just okay.
Closing Thoughts:Monsters, Inc. is another Pixar film that everyone should own.
This CD player is just made for the CDs here and too small for anything else.  
I am pleased with my purchase!
He is going to LOVE this movie and all the characters in it.  
Morrow is excellent as the whistle-blower.
It turns out that while humans are conditioned to fear monsters, so too are monsters trained to be terrified of human children.
I myself have not seen it.  
I love the mixture of thoughtfulness with good ol' "grunty" action and it's great to have a woman in the lead role of this kind of thing.
Yes and no.
My boyfriend and I bought this dvd to bring us back to our childhood because we really enjoyed the show when we were younger.
I soon lost count of how many times the character's lives were seemingly in danger, whether they were falling from high distances, or hanging on for dear life to prevent the former.
Some of the material the studio did for the military during WWII might rival it for animation prowess, but not for sheer storytelling on the commercial level.  
Highly recommend this one for all.
Beauty and the Beast is actually one of the finest movies to come out of the Disney studios.
If Alice, a child was afraid, little children watching her will be also.
MOVIE MARS IS THE BEST
Great for a Nemo fan of any age.
I am a collector of Disney movies and I keep my eye for the ones that hit blu ray.  
My son loves the collection of pirate of the Caribbean movies.
In my experience Season 2 seems to be the most popular and beloved season of the show among fans and critics alike and it's a hard belief to argue against, though for me personally it's roughly tied for that honor with Season 3, which sadly most seem to regard as the start of the downward spiral of the show.
Came in perfect condicition the little girl I sent it to, love it she suffer from Batten Disease and love this gif for her!
Should I review the film itself?
We love watching Rescue Rangers with the kids.
Sure Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather look like the three fairies, but their base is this crystal/glass looking clear thing that kind of looks like the top of an ocean wave, and it has a weird glitter like film over it.
great classic movie and many special features available for the whole family to enjoy
It's in her bed every night.
I bought this as a gift for my grandchildren.  
And furthermore,  it was either Three Men and a Baby or Police Academy that had the dubious honor of making Steve Guttenberg a star (so much for it being the Stonecutters).Then again, who's keeping track?I prefer the sequel for no other reason than a five year old is more fun than a bald, gender-ambiguous, personality-ambiguous baby.  
Like I said, this is one of the best animated features ever made.
alot better than alot of sets I've seen.
It is good quality and exactly what I expected from the description.
We got these as stocking stuffers for christmas and he likes them as much as anything else we got.
However, due to my love of this movie as a child, I cannot completely hate it.
It has always been hard to find great villain dolls, especially favorite characters - and I couldn't be happier with this sly villainess.
Funny and tearful.  
i purchase this movie thinking it was a dvd...and when i recieved it
Throw Mummy From the Train: On a vacation to mysterious Egypt, the Rangers agree to help a mummy retrieve a ring from a thieving archaeologist's assistant before he mistakenly brings a demon sphinx to life!  
Smart actors, snappy dialog, art direction that captures a detailed slice of NY in the mid fifties.
Finesse will take you a lot further than didacticism.
We only use the comforter and pillow case from this set.
It fits perfectly in our tiny shower and she loves to splash around in it.
It's funny and great.
The season expands more on each character, giving more details to their background and current emotional struggles.
The story is a great reminder of how we as humans have an impact on nature, animals, and the world we live on.
My daughters have a lot of the princesses like this and I knew they would love these.  
Highly recommend this seller.
Have a Merida doll that needed her Angus.
I received this days before I expected it to arrive.  
Between the timeless story and the work that went into this blu ray, I can't recommend it enough.
I thoroughly was entertained and grabbed at the opportunity of owning it on DVD.
Worked like a charm.  
A fan and this series will be "friends for life, through thick and thin - with another Tale to Spin!"
I have always loved this Disney movie and I am so glad to have my own copy of it now!
My son loves watching this.
The Peter Pan That Almost Was - (21:01) Ron Clements and John Musker introduce viewers to the various ideas that went into creating Peter Pan over its many years of being developed.
I was really disappointed that it wouldn't play on my computer at school (not a really "new" machine, or anything) and tried it on a variety of computers in my classroom.  
The price was great, some sellers want a lot more, $20 more.
The movie hits on multiple levels, which is what makes it better than the sum of its parts.
It is a children's classic.  
But I suspect you are wondering why I purchased this particular Limited SteelBook Edition Blu-ray 3D from France, well I am not going to pay well over inflated prices that are on offer from other Amazon outlets and it is a small price to pay for a Cover that is only partially in English.
I own the Gold Edition of this release and it will have to do until a decent upgrade comes along.
Please check out the other purchasers that are watching this for a more concise review.
After sending the children to bed, George and Mary Darling leave their home to attend a formal party.
I know I read the measurements before I purchased the set, but they are skinny too.
Must have gotten misplaced when I had moved 3 times.
My daughter quickly found out that pressing his paw makes him say/do things a lot more than just hitting him on his head which she first started doing.
"Quiz Show", directed by Robert Redford and starring John Tuturro, Ralph Fiennes, and Rob Morrow, begins with a salesmen showing a prospective buyer a new Cadillac.
It was such an easy question that his faltering will be just that much more dramatic.
Love, love, LOVE The Little Mermaid so of course I jumped at the chance to review The Little Mermaid Diamond Edition!
I found that the funniest parts were during the third act.  
THIS IS A VERY NICE DOLL
Arrived very quickly, awesome condition, played without any problems.
None of the characters are married but all have intimate standings.
Bringing the Story To the Screen2.
I travel a lot with my daughter and wanted to have a bath wherever we were.
Wanted something to go with the Command Center......why don't they make that?
it's not flimsy at all, that was what I was worried about.  
My granddaughter loves this series on Halloween - having the DVDs she can watch them anytime she wishes.  
When she is not using it, she carries it around in the sack it comes in!
My favorite is Lumiere, the maitre d, a candelabra with a very smooth style and an illuminating personality.
The tale of Alice is a classic, and the DISNEY version is the definitive animation of it!!!
All I can say is:
The doll appears to be very well constructed.
There are some pretend scenarios, but princess lovers are sure to make up their own, including adding a few "rules" of their own.
I thought they were going to be a little bigger and better made.  
The story was standard with nothing new in the mix, the dialog between the characters was wooden and unnatural, and i think i was the only one who hated Larry the Cable Guy's car Mater.
When Charles van Doren and Mark Goodwin cast off a small sailboat into a tame lake, Charles remarks, "Remember when being smart was like being cross-eyed?"While I was too young to remember much about the quiz show scandals, I do remember the worshipful attitude schoolchildren and teachers had towards the Van Doren family, especially in northwestern CT, where I grew up and they lived.  
Not sure how long the hair will stay tidy as it is easily snagged during gentle play.  
Note that all of these items are plastic and will break if someone over 200 pounds steps on them!
Aurora is never given the opportunity for heroism and is simply rescued by Prince Philip, Cinderella suffers much but has given up to dispair when the Fairy Godmother finally appears to rescue her, Ariel selfishly and foolishly jeopardizes her own life and her father's kingdom, etc.  
I understand that there must be some kind of wiring or something in his legs so that he stands but it makes him less cuddly.
Right now it's available for a cheap price but like a few reviewers here have mentioned- the price could go up around the holidays.  
My daughter and I have movie night on the weekends.
The Little Mermaid is one hour and twenty-five minutes and was released in theaters on November 14, 1989.
The total for everything was $60.12 including shipping and no tax.
What I loved about this movie:1-
I usually bend down the side first to empty out 75% of the water, and then flip it, but a valve would be a whole lot easier.
but I cannot find a VHS player .
The only complaints I have are that the blue gem fell off of the curling iron and the string on the zipper is a little short.
you can never go wrong with Disney.
And you can literally see every stroke of brush and pencil in those amazing drawings.
He seemed impressed with "Elfego Baca," but this is what he said about "The Swamp Fox":"Whether historically accurate or not, this series places its interest more strongly into the battles and campaigns conducted by patriots like Marion than in any of the individual characters who might have figured into its stories.
This was just one of a large number of brilliant effects from sea-monsters to maelstrom, from a goddess to naval battles.
Greatest show from my childhood!!!  
But what a legacy he left behind!And how great of the Disney studio that they keep on honouring him, with the fond recollections in the extra features of their disks (and how very opposite the treatment Warner Brothers gave him in their recent remastering of his only other movie, Little Shop of Horrors, for which he isn't even mentioned once in the endless end credits even though he wrote all the lyrics and the screenplay).And this is the best of the lot because, one day during the development of The Little Mermaid, he gave the Disney team a lecture on the nature and structure of great musicals that feature female leads - an archetypal analysis.
But when I saw the package I was disappointed in the size of the planes.
This is a really good movie.
The video doesn't take up my entire screen (I have a 55" TV).
If you are familiar with other versions of the story, you will realize that once again some elements of the story have been changed for the movie.
Awesome!!!!!!!!
The bow handle also has a slit/notch to place the arrow in which helps to hold the arrow in place while you propel it.  
I think no traditional-animated film has looked better.
However, the uneasy alliance between humans and Gargoyles is soon betrayed, and the Gargoyles are put under a Spell for 1.000 years.
I was a little disappointed that it was not in (Widescreen Edition) as advertised.  
Overall, I'm incredibly happy with my purchase.
This movie taken an interesting approach the the stale era of romantic comedies and it does a good job of doing so.
But, I don't think you will find it anything groundbreaking at any rate.
I watched it, and boy!
That's not to say the movie doesn't have its moments.
But it would be worth buying otherwise.  
[...]=
Detailed animation add to the action, humor, and characterization.
The score, by Alan Menken, is excellent as well.
I hadn't enjoyed "Alice in Wonderland" as much as, say, "Peter Pan" or even "101 Dalmatians", so the tape gathered dust over the years and my recollection of the movie got buried in my mind.  
They are inflatable back pieces, with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style.  
Hope that Jungle Book comes out soon on Blu Ray and gets the Sleeping Beauty treatment.
The show is quite daring for any kind of television, much less what was seen as a kid's show.
It is just a good movie that is worth watching.
The only thing I don't like is the voice/pull string is battery operated.  
This thing just seems like a standard kids CD player that you plopped a few mickey stickers on.
that the Magic spell has been broken, the Struggle between Heroes and Villains continues in Season 2 with 26 Episodes in three DVDs and Bonus Features.
The 3D version uses more of a (3d depth) visual effect as opposed to a (3d pop-out) effect.
My daughter loves this movie, I prefer the 2nd myself as it has a cool james bond feel to it.
I did like Mike and Sullivan.  
As a child my mother only let me watch this movie on special occasions because of the Caterpillar doing opium, however I had no idea at 5 what that was.
no one is slacking or just whacking off in the corner.
I love this movie!
It was a great purchase.
I'm just going to say this up front; it has little to teach anyone morally or religiously, but in spite of this, I think this is one of the most fun movies I've ever watched.
You'll really enjoy it.
so the kids watch and learn, but don't know until the next day when they can pick up the thing they learned in real life!
Of all the characters, the crocodile is my personal favorite.  
I purchased all three seasons and they're fantastic!
Ariel's mission to see the boy she likes ended up being what she always dreamed of, meeting a good-hearted hero, willing to save her life from the wicked (and my all-time favorite villainess) Ursula!
They are approx.6 inches tall and very detailed and colorful.
From Davy in Louisiana, to fighting the Indians, to the last fight at the Alamo, this is great light historical Television from Disney.  
So many truths would have to be taught such as stranger danger, dont talk to strangers, dont eat or drink things that a stranger gives you, it could be drugs or poison, dont run away from home or leave the home without a parent, you could get hurt and everyone is not nice.
won't hurt little hands.
In any case, it rendered the end of the Ashman-Menken team a tragedy on a par with the end of Adler-Ross.  
One of the best Disney movies of all time!
For the record, the establishment of higher learning that is portrayed as Columbia U (my alma mater) is actually Fordham University, the Jesuit University of NYC, possibly an even more gorgeous campus, where my daughter attends school.  
banderas has action down to a science this film says it all the critics didn,t think that way but i,ve got a theory bout that one decided he didnt like the actor then all you need is a closed mind and the review lands the film in the toilet maybe even more it addresses  issues  and handles them so perhaps this is a couple shades above that  so go get a banana and see it you will discover that it is just that shade better than you think
It is a very sweet-looking doll and the doll looks like a child.  
There are those few moments in life where people have to realize that it's okay to let someone into your heart even if they're completely different from the rest of us.
The Chandelier hanging from the ceiling during the ballroom dance scene will take your breath away.  
Overall my son loves it and that's what matters most.
While the general opinion seems to label Chicken Little as a failure (or at the very least a failure in living up to its expectations), I tend to consider this, the first fully computer generated feature film produced in-house by Disney, a thoroughly enjoyable experience from beginning to end with just enough charm to appeal to viewers of all ages.
Then you also have two new deleted scenes, one newly found song "Twitterpated (which I think was good it stayed out of the movie) and an interactive art gallery.
Twins were used to portray Adam Szalinski.
Bought as a gift for a 2 year old who loves to dress up she loved every outfit as well as the trunk it came in
Every Tangled fan must have her own little Flynn to parade around as their Bachelor of the year, too!
Graphics are older, but have been made a little crisper.  
Whoever designed this definitely thought of all the pieces.
This is not something I watch over and over again.
It doesn't hurt a bit that the story is terrific too.
Good quality overall for such a fantastic TV show!!
This is a movie from years ago which I used to own on VHS but haven't owned or seen in years.  
At first I thought the doll won't be much better then the one that I got here because on the picture they look almost the same.then the doll arrived and we all grasped for air.
The Italian automobile technology challenging the American technology was overlapped by two colliding cultures, accents, and tales.
The background information on the film is fascinating and gives you an entirely different perspective.
My almsot 3 year old LOVES LOVES LOVES
Not that I want the balls to come shooting out but we spent a good long time trying to figure out how to work it, when there was nothing to "work" about it.
Thank You D.D.
The characters they encounter along the way include three sharks trying to wean themselves from eating other fish, as is their natural instinct, including a great white named Bruce(Barry Humphries),Ancor, a hammerhead shark( Eric Bana) and Chum, a Mako shark (Bruce Spence).Marlin and his new companion manage to get past them as they battle their way across the South Pacific to find Nemo, meeting many who will either help or hinder their efforts.
The DVD we had was worn out so I was excited to get the blu-ray/dvd combo.  
It's cool and has a great story behind it.
I noticed on Amazon they sold them.
They also loved Tinkerbell (as they had seen her before in her own movies).
This is a type of film that didn't really need to utilize the surround channels, but it does a little in scenes showcasing crowd ambience.  
She also has to fight others,including a handsome nobleman, who are trying totake her throne.  
The action, humor and drama holds up like an old time radio show long forgotten (Check out "Batman: The Animated Series"...).
So we got it for home so everyone could watch it.  
My granddaughter got into Halloweentown this past fall.  
However, she's good with her toys -- and the smallest character in this set is Clover the bunny, who's about 1 1 /2" tall.  
Even Johnny Depp's acting is poor and not  a good example of what he is capable of doing (keep it in mind that he is not a great actor to begin with).
While the club can't change what is going on in her life, they can raise funds for new furniture.
Safe for children to watch & adults will like it too.
So basing a recommendation of her reaction, 5 stars.
after accidentally shrinking Nick(Robert Oliveri) and the babysitter with the Shrinking Ray.
Character Art Galleriesa.
It looks great on his bed and he couldn't wait to lay on it and have lighting on his pillow.
One of Disney best movie for the family.
I can still see Bambi sprawled out on the ice when he cannot stand up, and playing with Flower and Thumper as if it were today.
It's also a lot harder to inflate than the duck tub.
My twins love it and watch is constantly on their kindles.  
What I love best about Golden Age animation is often the backgrounds.
Radiator Springs struck me as a old town you expect to see in 1950s America.
I WOULD HAVE KEPT HIM HAD SHE BEEN UP TO PAR!
The product was as described and delivered on time and in great shape.
I kept thinking that I know this story... then realized that it came from a book "The Eaters of the Dead" that I read y-e-a-r-s ago...
Bring home the humour and heartfelt emotion of the epic adventure that captured the Academy Award for Best Animated Film [2003] now even more with this awesome Disney's Pixar's Finding Nemo Limited Steelbook Edition Blu-ray 3D!
we had all the videos from disney and wore them out.  
I looove how soft they are!
It worked perfectly as a special gift.
Tarzan rescues Jane and takes her back to her camp.
When their watching Sofia on TV they play with them pretending she is right there.
What is the story about?
The gags are for the most part silly, that the whole scene is set in spring when only shortly before the whole castle was deep in snow is illogical, and that the castle already has its "rosy" look, as if the spell had already been broken does not make sense either.
A great movie for families.
and they got more than one use out of it.
It looks cheap and tacky, and doesn't match the rest of the figurines in the set.
The East India Company, sometimes nicknamed "John Company," really did have a vast fleet and their own private army and navy, but their military and naval forces only had authority to operate in India, waters near India, and to defend convoys on the trade routes to India.
This doll is really cute, my daughter loves Doc McStuffins.
THIS IS GREAT FOR FAMILY NIGHT OR ANY NIGHT.  
The seller was GREAT about accepting it as a return.  
You watch as "Nanny" continues to expand upon her romantic interest with Mr. Wilkes, from the previous film.
The restaurant scene where Max is drinking and confesses his love to Ms. Cross is really exceptional, as well.
Eat you heart out Barny
It is a wonderful family movie
These five dysfunctions are absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results.
This Grannie would love it for the grandkids.
The Blu Ray looks and sounds stunning and all the extras have been ported over from the DVD release in 1080P.
It sounds like static, not smooth like I would have wanted.  
well and this is a solid wood puzzle.
This whole scene reminded me of a Dali painting.
This was an entertaining movie and very believable.
And of course, the animation and how free flowing the characters are, especially in the dance scene.  
If you have ever heard and seen a very happy Granddaughter at Christmas this is a great doll to get.
The has three play modes.
Anyways, point is, you're a Gargoyles fan?
She loves playing and talking to these characters.  
I had that hair color for a couple months when I was 20 and in college.
perfect addition to our mickey bathroom.
My 2 1/2 year old son recently celebrated successful potty training.
It certainly does.
They are catchy tunes but also efficient storytellers, especially the "Something There" montage that shows Beast and Belle turning from a state of mutual dislike to one of friendship.  
She killed the film, plain and simple.
I saw that the seller was having problems with these Blu-ray's quality, and that they were on hold.
They did a great job on the 3D animation, almost as good as the IMAX underwater
I find this movie very cute and funny.  
The good new is the episodes that are included look remarkably good for their age.
The characters are amazingly written!  
Shame on me!
4 stars from me.
Sully's and Boo's developing relationship mixed in both laughter and tears.
I found this film very delightful and was quite funny in places.
It wasn't bad as such, but I had a hard time connecting with this film.
My son loves both the Cars movies and I couldn't find Sally and Doc at a price I would pay.
And the pictures are not all that obvious, yet she seemed to get almost all of them with no problem :)
Get your popcorn and drink ready and have a lot of laughs.
my grandbaby had me watch it
and if i didnt catch her she would have fell diving out, and even came super close to hitting the water nosel.
This movie is actually better and I did not think that he could top The Truth About Spring.
I've never generally liked his work.
Finally, the animation and graphics are really stunning, with smooth action, spectacular level of detail and vivid colors.
I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own.  
Pocahontas - David Ogden Stiers6.
Dali in motion picture.
Wait, call your local store daily before they open.  
My grandson loves it.
Just small figures about 2 inches tall each but allow lots of imaginative play at a low cost.
It's so hard to find a movie we can watch with the entire family.
SPECIAL FEATURES:"The Insider" come with the following special features:Production Featurette - (7:05) Featuring a production featurette with the real Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand with commentary by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.
HER FEET ARE BIG AS TO MAKE HER STAND ;WHICH IS GREAT EVEN HER WRISTS BEND!
We have added a "lean forward" element.
Out of our all Disney dolls and creatures, this one is the least popular with the kids as well.  
The headband for it is tight on my 5 year old.
Do not be fooled by the fact that this is a cartoon, this is NOT a movie for young kids.
The Little Mermaid III Musical Sneak Peek (Direct-to-DVD promo)*
He was perfect for this part, he is a very versatile actor.
Definitely in the top 10 shows from the 90s.....Tim, Al  Wilson & Jill......an almost perfect combo to provide tons of laughs for the whole family......worth every penny to own this awesome show!
The Good Stuff/Extras:* Disney's Second Screen - Expand the fun by synching your internet-connected computer or iPad with the movie and access additional content.
We wanted to expose our grand daughter to our ancestral background at a young age, and this delightful movie fit our intent nicely!
Here is why this was a good purchase.1.
This is really a suspenseful movie and we really loved it.  
Since the seasons are so expensive and rare for Disney I bought this.
Great for Christmas Gift or Birthday Gift.
There are a couple funny moments, & the eagles are cool characters, but this isn't an episode you'll be playing again anytime soon.  C-3.
Audio Quality 4.5/5There are two English audio tracks included, along with French and Spanish tracks.
One Hour in Wonderland*
Cannot wait until I can share this with my children!
Well made, no issues.
In all, and contrary to the trend that Pixar just continues to outdo itself in each subsequent effort, it is almost ironic that having watched the lackluster sequel in the theater led me back to the original and of course to rediscovering the charms that separate the good films from the great ones.
It is important to remember that we watch this from an adult perspective now and with adult sensibilities and political correctness and sheltering our kids can go too far; kids are more hardy than we give them credit for.
The 1080p just makes for better viewing.
She adores bears but is currently terrified of them.
My daughter pulled the sting all 5 times to hear the phrases and on the 6th pull the string failed to retract.
Are you kidding?
My son received this in his stocking at Christmas.  
But one /does/ have such reactions with early Disney animation, when colors seem to have the wrong hue, or to be overly saturated.
Can't wait for the sequel.
And they're absorbent as well, unlike some other decorative towels.
The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them.
In fact it seemed as if a good chunk of the movie was a character trying to outrun something scary trying to eat them.  
I do recommend this movie.
We see Wigand as he suffers excrutiating choices as the tobacco company threatens not only to cut his severance package, but it seems that his very life and those of his family are being threatened.  
Enjoyed watching through the episodes again.
That is covered in movies specific to that, and there are several.
Instant video is always good.
Chipwrecked Shipmunks - The Rangers are wrecked on a tropical island and meet once again with the Pi-Rats, who are looking for a treasure that Monterey and Dale have already found.  
She loved the color.
a dark powerful series, all who loved their childhood should seek this.
I think it was from most people labeling this film as a girl's movie.  
I love my bambi movie so cute and all kids would love this movie I know I loved it the best all the animals in this movie are so cute
An UNCENSORED & UNCUT version of MELODY TIME is available to buy at Amazon.co.ukThe Region 2 UK Disney DVD has all of Pecos Bill's cigarette scenes intact including the cut scene that's missing from the Region 1 DVD of Pecos Bill roping the tornado and lighting his cigarette with a lightning bolt.
Good movie,well made not what I usually collect,was a gift to me from a good friend so am pleased with it and grateful for the gift,can add to your collection as i did and is worth watching again and again.
Progression of Marni's growing up and trying to learn her abilities as a witch - the good kind.
A must own for any 3D OWNER!!
This is a great movie for Kids but may be a little boring for adults.
For the price this set really can't be beat.  
She absolutely loves it and the fact that it stores the puzzle pieces and that they are wood it super will last for many years.
Things are removed, things added, but it doesn't seem inappropriate.
My dad wanted this movie since he saw it, so when he opened it, it was so glorious.
Anne Hathaway is engaging and girls will love the film.
If you guess right you get the gems on the card for your jewelry.
I don't care if he was a kid; he got what was coming to him.
We absolutely love the little mermaid and were so happy to have it finally out on bluray.
At one point his wife decides that the pressure is too much for her to bear, so she leaves, taking the kids with her.
I have big down comforters and I don't know if they are as warm as this Princess Comforter.  
And Bambi may be one of the best animated movies of all time.
The scenery in the movie is awesome.  
The dad's shouting, there's fighting, tinker bell and the mermaids do mean things to Wendy, etc.
so I would say this is a pretty durable toy.
Extremely well written and paced, with excellent choice of locations.
I just wish companies would stop squeezing these things in small plastic bags and in the boxes where they get disformed
His plans are interrupted when Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world resulting in a city wide panic because the monsters have always believed human children were toxic.
It goes great with her décor and doesn't take up much space.  
When I first started the movie, I could see what the fuss was about.
It pains me to have to give a Pooh movie 1 star but I did not like this one at all.
And then he died and the Disney studio slumped into mediocrity.
Great story and a performance by Ellen DeGeneres that reaches all ages.  
no I am small.
It is even better that it still has the same girl in it.
This price is ridiculous.
Great for younger children because it is mostly about Adam, and believe it or not, its tamer than the original.
No further comment is required.
REALLY GREAT ITEM!
A year later, the humiliation still lingers.  
The message that one can persevere even if the underdog is great.
And while that theme in and of itself is a good one to know (ugly isn't always nasty, pretty isn't always nice--and when the two are in conflict, it's what's on the inside that matters more), I'm not altogether surprised that they went the metafiction route with this film, so that Belle likes to read adventures and fairy tale romances and such (Disney would be more obvious about this kind of thing with The Princess and the Frog).  
Thinking I would hit 'Play' and do some work while it provided some background noise, I found myself glued to the screen for the entire film.
She looks like the movie character, has lots of beautiful long hair, she is very posable and just looks great.
I was hoping for action and exhilarating moments but no...all I got from the film was twelve characters, whom I have no idea who they are, and Antonio Banderas' two facial expressions: looking for words to express and feigning disbelief.
Disney should continue to make movies like this.
Seller added enough describtion of the movie to let me know it was perfect for my grand daughter.
a bit too sleepy
Really excited to give it to him!
I LOVE the theme of this movie especially for young children...
Holy crap, I'm in love with Zooey Deschanel.
We also get two deleted songs and two deleted scenes pulled out of the Disney Vaults for our enjoyment.
I hadn't seen "Home Improvement" in years, but I enjoyed it when it was a regular tv show.  
Special Features  •  Aquariums  •  
Helen Hayes (one of the tourists leaving the hotel).
It slides around a bit on our elongate toilet seat, but this has not been a major problem.
I am pleased to say that is not the case.
The other females are the "twins" who are idiotic little groupies and then the models for Dinoco who are there for nothing other than being pretty.
This is a funny movie.
I loved watching these types of movies when I was growing up either on TV or at the drive-in...
There were interludes of strange haunting vocals, that didn't seem to have anything logical to do with the story, but they were really effective in demonstrating the enormous pain and strain that the men were facing.
My three year old LOVES it.
You have cars talking and acting like people for God's sake!
Park, Four Holes Swamp, Arches Nat'l.
Super cute and fun.
The children love the video.
The doll broke very quickly, the leg joint broke, and then we lost an arm.
Personalized it with iron on letters.
These are pretty cool.  
I did not give it a one star only because my 3 year old son will still play with them off the ships.  
Best decision that I ever made.
I'm okay with that, not really a big 3D guy anyway.
No wonder Melanie Griffith married him...she has the same qualities.
It is amazing to me that Blu Ray technology has now been out for as long as it has, and it still doesn't work.
It's a stunning addition to the Pixar filmography, and one that everyone would be proud to own.
But considering how long it's probably been sitting in the plastic wrap, I'm surprised there's even a hint of a scent there at all, even if it's no longer strawberries.
You won't regret buying this because it's a timeless classic that you can enjoy over and over again, with family, or by yourself.  
it's beautifully done and I can't wait to give it to my daughter for her birthday.
Someone at Amazon has written this statement on almost every 3D movie they're selling.
Kim is an empowering young woman who kicks butt.
The characters are original and charming; the plot is creative (a monster factory collects kids' screams, which are turned into energy.
The filming of the elephants is excellent.  
Also you have a view of the new ride of MI in Tokyo and an interactive game.
Both of these are masterful hours of television for the most part though the first 10 minutes or so of Phase One crosses the line of what I'm willing to see on network television.
Cinderella brought the studio back from the WWII setbacks.
This is a fantastic movie and my toddler loves the characters.
I got this for my mother and she loves it, its all about family and what they go through and how to solve some family problems.  
The documentary is informative and very entertaining with insight and humor told by these two very talented men who formed a life long friendship.
so it comes off easily and puts on easily.
This product was for a gift and the little boy just love it.
Although my son likes having all the clubhouse friends, they don't work with Fly 'n' slide Clubhouse playset.  
what's behind the closed closet door in their bedroom?
I highly recommend this movie.
Third is like a bonus round where you get three images of the same car and you have to pick which one is accurate (with the other two having often the slightest differences in them).The reward for going through the game (which you cannot get out of until you finish the movie with it) is a Showroom that has all the cars you found.
It's Nemo how can you NOT like it!I have always loved this movie and watched it with my 5mth old as many times as the rental would allow!
Jiminy shows his talents here as being much more than Pinocchio's sidekick and conscience, and the live-action bits prove to be as delightful as the two animated stories showcased within.
There's just a slight shortage in the bust so it's snug and barely closes.
This products is really wonderful!
my daughter is 4 and she gets a kick out of watching a giant sized baby roam vegas.  
it is one of my favorite movies i've ever seen.
Mickey goes to bed with him, watches tv with him and goes in the car and goes out with him, as well as his I Pad and Mickey Mouse fun book with songs.
The Golden Fleecing is based on the legendary Greek mythology about the precious wool substance for Launchpad with Scrooge and the boys go out to the black sea to find it as they discover four harpies and a man-eating dragon guarding it, guest starring the famous Ludwig Von Drake.
I always loved the movie Hook, with Robin Williams.
Bottom line this is the best version of the movie ever released, and a must purchase before it goes back into the Disney Vault.  
"Through My Eyes" Video- Brother Bear Games (Bone Puzzle; Find Your Totem)-
The Beast has performed a self-serving act, to be sure, but he is certainly becoming less selfish than before.  
All films that end with the character waking up from a dream usually lose some points with me anyway.  
They would be very hot for sleeping on and would not allow the skin to breathe.  
LOVES LOVES this movie!
This is one of the earlier conversion attempts (2005) and it shows.
The extras are very good, but of course we have the exclusions from previous releases yet again, overall this is a very satisfying release.
Anyways, to conclude this review, this DVD (and the first two) should be given a chance for its use of nostalgic footage and teaching young girls the importance of "beauty from within," which it does.
My son loved the first classic movie, and that is why I got the second one for him.
Other qualities - the doll's outfit can be taken off with ease, it has snap on velcro tinny thingies on the back of pants and top
School's Out is perfect for any fan of the Disney classic TV show. :)
she does some pretty amazing stuff
Does all the lines and noises from the movie.
This was purchased to placate a testy 6 year old who couldn't wait until next school year for a new box.  
On the whole, the picture quality was quite good.
Perfect game for any little princess.
The backgrounds almost pull your attention from the man action to just watching the elements of the undersea environment.  
The movie was shipped on time and in perfect condition.
We see Bambi learn how to walk and talk, always with the help of his friends.
Yes, I would certainly would buy from this seller again.
Special features remain the same, albeit the missing "Inside a Scene" which was relevant in 2000, not so much today.  
This doll is good for a collector or for playing with.
And on Blu-ray, the colors are the star of this film.
This is a great toy.
When his father was swallowed by the whale, along with the cat, goldfish and rest of the house, I was surprised.
Boy, was she a character!
This was great.  
It seems to be an even split.
DuckTales - Volume 2  any volume will do--  the duck kids and  scrooge off in various adventures all about money--i think they need to remake it and update its look for todays  experience -owens
I just love it and the robot has outstanding personality.
But she loves him
Gotta love Disney for that!The supplements are very good, but hardly the treatment that Snow White received, all and all it's a worthy purchase, but I won't be getting rid of my Gold Edition any time soon.
This set of toys includes all the major cast members and they are very sturdy.  
The Diamond Edition definitely is clearer.
Nice family adventure movie.
Seeing Gadget make a rocket ship out of garbage is cool, but that's the only good thing in this episode.  D-12.
On the other, there are things like the Whistleblower Protection Act and other efforts to keep these individuals from retaliation.
it brings back memories from Disney channel its like the jungle book combined with their characters like scrooge mcduck and chip n dale this is the best
I know she was asking for a Perry.
Here is volume 2 feature more episodes from 1987 till 1988 that has more adventures of everyone's favorite richest duck in the world named Scrooged McDuck (Voiced by Alan Young) and his family.
As they anticipate their impending parenthood, the worrywart Merlin wonders, "What if none of them like me?"
They don't get bent as easily as the small puzzle pieces.
The reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 is because when I pulled them out of the package they had an odd smell to them.  
Great acting, great movie, family viewing if kids don't mind native type movies.  
It had a very dry and droll sense of wit.  
They are plastic, but they are for play and are going to get beat up no matter
Also, since she watches the show ALL THE TIME, she knows the other characters, of course, and she been telling me that Perry needs his friends, so I went ahead and ordered her Phineas, Ferb, and Dr Doofenshmirtz, which are the three friends that she mentioned by name that Perry needed.
I was kind of bored in the theater with this film.
If nothing else these can be added to her collection of dress up items and in a couple years we can teach little sister to play.
"Mermaid" is full of catchy tunes, the story is fun, and there is nothing here that doesn't entertain on so many levels.
This movie is a lot of fun to watch over and over.
The pieces are a little on the cheap side but the sparkle and cuteness make up for it.  
This is one of Disney's Greatest movies made,if you do not have this i recommend to pick up a copy,i know when i bought this,the price was cheaper,but even if i did not buy it,and i had to pay this amount
She really enjoyed the movies I gave her for Christmas this year!
A fun and visually rich movie.
Disney's 2nd effort, One of if not my personal favorite Disney animated films comes to Blu Ray with mixed feelings for me.
I highly recommend it.
Had I known in advance, I would have purchased there.
He rescues his puppet maker father from a giant whale named "Monstro."The movie ends happily with no departure from the happy old man's small home which celebrates the end of his loneliness, and the arrival of human company in his life.
This movie is about a boy, Jimmy, who lived his life in a bubble.
but I'd be ticked off if I paid the $30 that they are listed for currently on Amazon.
This DVD was used but it was in  condition.
Could have been cheaper.
Entertaining animation, and fun-filled for the entire family.
BUT.....  In past SUCCESSFUL films, they did this with great characters, music,  humor, etc.  
What can I say I named my first child after Jada she rocks!!!!
I don't like how the Belle skirt and Snow White skirt are the same so there is only 3 skirts included when it's a Princess package of Aurora, Belle, Cinderella and Snow White.
Fun and keeps you engaged.
It was going to be one episode in a never finished new version of "Fantasia"; finally, it's made available, by itself, in this Diamond Edition: truly worth watching.
I think the pieces are well made.
You get to see the real love for the source material and how much they put into making the movie as much a car-lovers movie as possible.
Good sequel to the first two Halloweentown movies.  
For those of us who grew up with the film, the film is nostalgic.  
I wish more parents would forgo all the lame Grrrrl Power dreck that Disney produced in the last 20 years and buy classic Disney for themselves and their children.
Naturally this led to ABC green-lighting a second season of the show.***If you have not seen season 1 of Alias, and don't like spoilers, I recommend that you stop reading now***Sydney (Jennifer Garner) and her father Jack Bristow (Victor Garber) continue their crusade against SD-6 and its leader Arvin Sloane (Ron Rifkin).
He plays with them all the time.
This product would be greatly improved, and receive all 5 stars from me, if the area where the baby was placed was given some sort of non-slip treatment.
Half way in the movie it started to get fuzzy for like 20 minutes for the first half of the movie.
The transfers so far have been pretty much perfect and this film is no exception.
Disney usually is fun and enjoyable for the whole family but this was an attempt to go dark and the storyline arcs of the show are great with multiple epsiodes longing arching storylines and smart cartoon plots overall has become one of my favorite cartoons
That "Painting the Roses Red" song is just stupid, especially when the painters' cards are dragged away, they are singing stupidly about being beheaded!
I got a great deal.
Also this was the last movie of Disney's Renaissance era.
I'm incredibly disappointed in the quality of this product and would highly recommend just going to your local toy store and purchasing one that will likely be of a higher quality.
picture quality very good also.  would recommend it to anyone who likes these type of movies
It is not only about cute animated characters, but also about true love for family and friends.
Even the errant machine HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey asked if he would dream after he was turned off.
Tarzan is one of my favorite disney movies.  
Their stone state will seal and heal any cuts, bruises and abrasions! ...
The wheels also turn and the propellers spin with kid power!!!
Have always loved this movie.
A Native American youth named Kenai witnesses the death of his eldest brother and blames his death on a bear who unbeknownst to him was protecting her cub.
Make sure you know what you need and what you are buying.
recommended to those whom are interested in this genre of DVDmovie/films.......
Most of my moive collection is for older kids and adults, with one grand child and 2 more on the way my wife and I decided we need to expand the collection so they would have something to watch when they came over.  
'ArmStrong' + 'Robot Robbers' is a good 2 part episode where Scrooge and his enemy Flint Heart have to put aside their differences to save the day.
You have to keep swashbucklers European, otherwise they turn into those martial arts films.
Great deal for this.
Loved DuckTales as a child and had to have this!
Of course, everyone wants to borrow my copy.  
I ordered this one and my husband read it before we even left.
This was the fourth of six Disney films put out from 1942 to 1949.
Just don't take it too seriously.
The animals are hard to get on the sink to talk, so the kids have a hard time putting them on to get them to talk, and they only say one phrase each, and even then it has had a few glitches, such as the lamb will be on the sink, and it will say what Stuffy is supposed to say...
Well, they ARE pirates, after all.
The River Pirates is not nearly as good as King of the Wild Frontier, but it is a great set.
Ella just adores her Flynn Rider doll, and the horse he rode in on, she asked for these two repeatedly for her birthday (she had never been so hooked on a movie before so boy, did I indulge her), and he just rides all over the "land" on his big white horse rescuing maidens, via my daughter, I don't even think she realizes she's pimping him out and that she's making him cheat on Punzie, lol.  
A greatmovie to sit down and enjoy
At the climax of the movie Bambi is a full grown buck and he views the forest from a very steep peak.
Love this Beuwolf based movie.
The sheets/pillowcase are SILKY to the touch.
The movie is different than the book in several ways and frankly I liked the book better as the Wendol were just as evil but also vastly different than the characters in the movie.
It's that good.
The construction is solid and should last a lifetime.  
It's a cluttered muddle that simply does not capture the essence of the Lewis Carroll books, mainly because Carroll's subtle humor is buried under an avalanche of Disney kitsch, but also because Disney failed to capture the willful, prickly spirit of the Alice character... or indeed, to give her any personality at all.
Ariel is a stereotypical Princess who thinks it's funny to tempt danger by having a shark chase her among other things.
It was a great investment.
All in all, not a great use of my money :(  
BUT, successful & a film I really like, Mulan had NONE of this on that set.
So, please if you remember this after school cartoon from disney than it may be time to make purchase if not for you for the kids, trust me they will enjoy.
Thus, the shows from Season 3 are better than those from Season 1.
Mary Pickford was to play a live Alice for Disney, along with Ginger Rogers--and even Margaret O'Brien, whose mother turned it down because of the price offered (a fact she recently told talk show host Stu Shostak on a recent shokusradio.com broadcast).By the time "Alice" was underway as an all-animated feature, the studio was still hurting from WWII losses, the 1950 release "Cinderella" had helped things considerably and high hopes were dashed when "Alice" initially underperformed at the box office.
String has not broken yet  but if pulled a ton or too hard I could see it being a problem.
I have been trying to navigate my way around the second disc of this movie for two days, its impossible .
The actors and the story it self is amazing .
My daughter actually keeps Beauty, and a few of her other Palace Pets, in her backpack to play with on the bus-ride home from school.
I would rate this 5 stars, except the crown is ridiculously annoying to wear.
You helped me find my perfect Woody.
I was so excited to watch this with my daughter so she could enjoy one of the classic Disney movies too.  
Package arrived within alloted time frame and was well packaged.  
Pinocchio then turns and says "Yeah!
There's also the fact that it's very much a boys' story, and for more reasons than the unrealistic depictions of females: Wendy, Tinkerbell and Tiger Lily.
This is a very nice sheet set.  
It's just not the alpha dog I remember it to be.  
The Little Match Girl (2006 Short)*
A great high-definition audio and video restoration packaged with an abundance of delightful extras make it an essential addition to every Disney home entertainment collection.
It was a big pleasure to watch the whole series once again.
I think the bases could have been sturdier, thicker, and been more in line with the theme.
I especially like the music accompanying their arrival to Pleasure Island.
The level of detail is very impressive from the waxed shine on the cars to the minute dust.
We took them to the new CARS exhibit at Disneyland last week where they were able to "meet" their favorite cars characters and they were just thrilled.  
This movie has some hilarious parts to it.
I ordered three Disney movies using my smartphone.
Too bad the chest was not better made.  
Both the humans and the animals are treated with fairness, and the "solutions", if you will, at the end of the film actually brought tears to my eyes.
If he wins he'!l get a major endorsement and be one of the elite cars of all of racing!  
This doll really looks like Flynn, but my kids think he also looks like Eric from The Little Mermaid, so this is a twofer!  
I may have choked up a time or two (see not a pod person comment from above).I know
His captains and crews not only obeyed that order, not only carried on obeying it for forty-five minutes while under battleship calibre gunfire, but did so sufficiently well to be mistaken for battleships from the world's most powerful navy.
During the game you can spin the  "wave" which makes you have to shake the box so the pieces go into other places and have to find them again.
My son was getting a lot of Jake and the Never Land Pirates items for Christmas and I ordered this to go with the rest of his items.
As someone who lives in Houston, it's still amazing to think that a big portion of Rushmore was shot here.
I mean...do you SEE how the patriarch--Charles' father, slices the SMALLEST pieces of cake ever?
I purchased this item for my 2 year old son.  
Key things to look for is Raja and shavlgreen gorgeous shawl.
I know it was a different time for movies then, but for those looking for something for younger kids, skip this one.
The adventure begins when Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole.
Disney Second/View/What is Disney SecondView -
While at Disney my kiddos decided we needed to add to our DISNEY DVD Collection.
My little Doc Mcstuffins fan received the dress up kit for a gift from her Aunt so we need the perfect little patient to go along with.
If you don't like it...return it to me!!
VIEWING VAULT.I'M GLAD
As for me, other great classics like Pinocchio, Cinderella and The Lion King are on my "to do list" to check out on DVD.
'Merit Time Adventure' is an interesting 'Scooby Doo' type Duck Tales where Scrooge's ships are being lost at sea.
It has a patch that says it's authentic, but you know what... those can be faked, too.
In the depths of the Great Barrier Reef, Marlin [Albert Brooks], an overly protective clownfish, embarks on a daring rescue mission when his beloved son, Nemo, get scooped up by a diver.
As a kid, this was wonderful.  
The only reason to dislike this film is Smith's decision at the end, to remain in the wilderness.  
If I remember there was a Scrooge McDuck comic with the art of Carl Barks.  
This easy to play board game is set up with five clear cellophane windows that have puzzle tiles covering your ability to peer beneath the waves into the caves (the puzzle pieces are pics of Ariel, King Triton, Ursual, Sebastion, and Flounder).  
I feel bamboozled.
Cute and well made.
MY LITTLE SISTER LOVES THIS LUNCH BOX, I LOVE IT
She can open it with the key, but then she will close it with the key inside.
Being a Pixar film, expect excellence in every area of the production.
Nice wallet for my 2 year old son, a Toy Story fan.
Note the use of Northmen not Norsemen, for the makers of the film wanted not to confuse, just entertain-which they do in remarkable and constant form.
A must have for little boys.
Gonna give digital copy to my son for the grand babies.
Denahi confronts Kenai on the mountain, but their fight is intervened by Koda who steals Denahi's hunting pike.
Guess she's a modern princess!
The only figurine that is still useful is the crocodile.
That is a really interesting take on the classic story.
and I love high definition videos a lot more than standard definition.
Pricey compared to other dolls but overall a nice addition and much better than a crappy cheaper alternative.
One of Disney's more unique animated films shows labor intensive animation marrying realistic and cartoony looking creatures in one film.
The characterizations cover the whole personality spectrum, from the charismatic men-of-few-words such as the superb Vladimir Kulich as the leader, Buliwyf, and Daniel Southern as Egtho "the Silent," to the cheerful and enthusiastic, embodied by the fine Tony Curran as Weath and Dennis Storhoi in a marvelous, central performance as the aptly-named Herger "the Joyous.
Childern will love this and adults will be glad they watched it too.
Must buy for all kids who love the show.
We're trying to cut down on clutter so having an extra DVD case and DVD laying around can add up.  
On his way to the run-off, Lightning accidentally ends up exiting I-40 to find himself on a forgotten stretch of The Mother Road, Route 66, speeding through the forgotten town of Radiator Springs.
My problem is these shorts are to long for their own good.
I am glad to have this in my movie collection!
But then of course comes the infamous transformation sequence, when Lampwick becomes an actual jackass.
There is a general reverence for the Bible and God by the lady missionary throughout and a few scriptures quoted.  
Neverland is definitely a destination we all would love to visit as children and Peter Pan makes it even more so.
If you want the 2-Disc DVD-only edition you'll have to wait until Nov. 23.
This is an adult's hat definitely.
You Can Fly!
and the tears and frustration to deal with.2.
This is one of my favorite stories and this is one of the better adaptation of it.  
This is one of my favorite movies.  
The dress is very poor and just so so average.
The TV series may not be the animation quality one see in the films or
I remembered watching this as a child and still enjoy it today.  
Julie And Sofia are great.
We have had this set for about a year now and the colors are still vibrant.
Like an audio commentary, this bonus feature accompanies the entire film, which plays on one part of the screen or another while expert commentators like Brian Sibley, Paula Sigman and many others discuss the film, Walt Disney, and especially Lewis Carroll, in a very sensitive and non-sensational way, offering thoughtful insights and endless details.
That's how crazy this movie gets.
The temperature feature didn't work, my daughter slipped all over and she hated it.  
Anne Hathaway I love everything that she plays in I have all of her movies and I will find more
I have around 4,000 Movies, and thanks to Amazon I am adding to it all the time.
but the story line is there kinda hard to to keep up with at first but still good movie
Alice in Wonderland seems to be Walt's original labor of love gone awry due to conflicting interests in other endeavors such as building up Disneyland or advocating for the space program to counter the Russians Alice among other films took second seat.
It's too bad that Disney doesn't bring back these quality shows.
Not scratched to where it doesn't play!
You will not be disappointed even though it is an oldie we watch it over again every once in awhile..
This is a cute movie for kids and fun humor for the parents or adults.
Biggest problem is that is slides all over and our son was terrified he was going to fall, into the toilet!
I am like, "Well, if you dislike what you were doing, then why continue to work for the company?
No.  I still felt entertained.  
Not sure how it will hold up over the years as it isn't too 'structured' -- more like layered dense fabric -- but so far so good.
I purchased Rockie and Bullwinkle and it did not stand up as well.
Beautiful piece, for a gift and a good price too.
it's a very cute set.
And, they are always excited to see what new movies Nana and Li'l
The graphics are first class and the story line solid.
Buzz lazer blaster is a great one.
The storyline is well-develped as well as the characters.
Another Webby focused episode, but it’s better than the other one.  B45.  
Buy this with relatively low expectations and then you will not be disappointed.
I wouldn't pay 14 dollars for it, but the 3 I spent was well worth it.
They just show you the scene where he's already inside the belly of the whale.
This seat has kept my child germ-free and happy for 2 years.
Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!).
She's been using it since she was 8 months old.
one too many times of setting to sea.
Order processingwas very smooth.  
Still, it is a cartoon made for children and so its an age-centric classic.
my boy just likes to put it next to his mickey and pluto and hang out with them all.  
somehow it is like super thin strands that get moppy and tangly.4.
The batteries are still going strong after a year of pretty regular use!
It is filled with the poignant Disney magic, which we all remember, but along with it comes a wonderful backstory to the coming about of Bambi; one of the Disney movies which revolutionized the world of animation, using the multiplane camera to further the realism effects obtained in Bambi, impressionistic backgrounds and realistic, yet human animals, round out just a few, of the many, interesting aspects of this 1942 classic Disney film.
Great Japanese animation movie.  
There are plenty of obstacles to hurdle: a prudish chairwomen, the need for sponsorship, and the nerves of the women themselves, but once they've hired a sympathetic photographer who worked as an orderly at the hospital whilst John was sick, the women gather together to drop their dressing gowns and pose behind various fruits, cakes, watering cans, knitting, pianos and plants.
I had this movie on VHS and my grandson watched it over and over.  
The sheets are soft and the comforter is fluffy and a really good size for a toddler set.
And 20-years later, "Beauty and the Beast" looks and sounds phenomenal on Blu-ray.
Unfortunately, a minor oversight led to a switch of two small cuts during the "Part of Your World" scene.
I usually love Russel Crowe and Al Pacino but this movie was waaayy toooo slooow.
You know the gist of the story and even how it ends more or less so the question really is is it worth the ride and this film answers with a resounding yes.
it has a lot of different aquatic species very colorful and entertaining
Released March 1, 2011.
Pacino is also compelling as the street smart, big mouth New Yorker, who we see develops a real sense of caring for Wigand.  
A great concept of clashing religions coming togetherto fight the battle of "The Eaters of The Dead".4.Loved the lessons of life learned all throughoutthis movie.
Even if you don't know much about cars or NASCARs, Cars is such fabulous entertainment their is no reason not to love it from beginning to end.  
By 12:00 the landing gear of El Chupacabra was broken off.  
I like how episodes play one after the other without having to go to a menu.  
Oh, and when you find your man, you WORK and sacrifice for him, going as far as permanent transfiguration (sacrificing your voice + changing your body) to chase down your man.  
First off, Ups and downs in this DVD:UPS: Ariel, Jasmine, Cinderella themed stories (and I guess Mulan), Teaching your child the theme of "Beauty comes from inside," Disney trailers, Storybuilder special feature, seeing Jasmine being turned to a snake and many highlights of that Aladdin episode, beautiful cover art and interactive CGi menus.
A great cartoon for anyone.
He is larger than I expected.
Perfect for family movie night.
You'll be glad you did!
Some backgrounds verge on the abstract, particularly in the Queen of Hearts sequence.
But if you are only after a little 80s nostalgia, the 3rd volume gives you the best package for your money.
Hurry and just buy it!!PD: You should know that this Diamond Edition of Bambi like the Diamond editions of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Beauty and the Beast, comes in two packagings: one in BD packaging and the other in standard DVD packaging.
I am an adult with very adult tastes regarding movies but I felt compelled to rate this review towards its primary demo, Children and there parents.
From what I can see Amazon sells both.
I love Disney movies and I love Beauty and the Beast.
This was a great buy, I'm glad I waited and bought online.
This is the third movie in the Halloween installments, and it is just as great if not better than the first two.
This is a great movie, I still like the first one best of all.
She really liked it.
She also goes undercover as a hooker; she slinks out in alternating red and black lingerie and makes a come-on to her client, only to turn on him and knock him unconscious.
Too bad as it is a nice picture.
The film is a classicA vain prince refuses to provide shelter and air to a haggard old woman on a stormy night.
Originally it was suppose to be a spin-off of "The Rescuers" with Bernard and Bianca with three new friends but the idea dropped, so they thought of having Chip (Voiced by Corey Burton) and Dale thrown into the mix with three new friends like Zipper the tough housefly, the beautiful Gadget Hackwrench (Voiced by Tress Macneille) and cheese-obsessed aussie mouse Montery Jack (Voiced by Peter Cullen) who go rescue those who are in need of help and to solve mysteries.
His expression alone is worth the buy.
The 3D is crisp, and it's just like watching a new movie.
Get it & the other one & maybe Disney'll release Season 2 Volume 2.
I got a bit confused when trying to figure out why was the movie made.
Very recommended!..
Really - it's that good.
Good size, not tiny.  
We bought this toy along with Buzz Lightyear, Bullseye and Rex for my son's birthday.
and I am impressed by how much of an upgrade this film looks compared to its previously awesome Platinum DVD release only four years ago.  
It's a classic, no question, but I don't seem the point of having the Blu Ray verision.
For anyone just wanting easy entertainment, sure I would recommend this.
Now it's available in 3D and HD - wow.
But "Alice in Wonderland" was one of the most difficult films for Walt Disney.  
Extremely pretentious and overly convoluted plot.  
Throughout A Low Down Dirty Shame, notice Keenen's hair; it keeps growing fast by the day.
I don't think a villain necessarily has to have any special powers to be more effective.
Both of these movies were to be full length features but due to World War II when a third of his staff was drafted into the arm services and the war department literally took over Disney Studios to make propaganda films and the lost of the European market force the two movies into one package film.
We loved the movie, and now that its on Blu-ray, we'll love it many more times with our granddaughters.
Her own imagination running the play, not something tecno dictating the direction of her own beautiful imagination.
You have nothing to lose but so very much to gain.
Once you get the hang of the story, you're caught!  
Nice price and beautiful.
Through the help of the servants (the enchanted objects), Beast and Belle learn to live together and even to enjoy each others' company.  
"Reference Footage:
I bought my older grand-daughter, Sven the Reindeer.  
Chicken Little abides by his father's wishes, and, in effort to follow in his father's footsteps, even joins the baseball team at school.  
But he's a rough kid, like any 3 year old, and the leg snapped off about 2 months in.
The inside bottom is a bit slippery so we put a non slip pad in.
This one is really cute.
Plus i completely destroyed the box trying to open him to begin with.
Why would the "seven dwarfs" need to lie in court when everyone know smoking isn't good for you?
They'll love it.
For fans of this Walt Disney Animated Classic, "Peter Pan" will continue to entertain children and people today and tomorrow, as the film has done for the last 60-years.  
He will love these characters!
From the same author that brought you Jurassic Park, The Great Train Robbery, Congo and Andromeda Strain (among others), it's not surprising how good this movie is.
Both Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox were enjoyable and I would rate a 4 out of 5, but the problem with this set is that we are only given 3 out of 10 Elfego Baca episodes and only 3 out of 8 Swamp Fox episodes.  
Crab-E-OKE gives viewers the opportunity to sing along with their favorite songs.
Perfect for a little girl who loves brave.
Both are offered at Amazon in various forms.
As well, it arrived faster than a speeding bullit!
My daughter is also a proud owner of 17" Limited Edition Rapunzel Doll from Disney store and I wish I got two of them as they came up to cost five hundred now.
this is a great movie.
After doing some research I learned that these 1st edition dolls are much better quality then their new 2nd editions dolls.
As they arrive, Captain Hook and his pirates are on the island and Peter, the kids, and the Lost Boys - Peter's gang - have to save the day.
I'm a big fan of underwater exploration, so there's a natural tendency for me to be biased in liking this film.
The cardboard just looks worn and shoddy even if you're very careful.
I grew up with the show.
They are still nice figurines, but not for what I wanted them for - my 2 1/2 year old to play with in his toy pirate ship.
The digital copy is great to have, just make sure you down load it sooner rather than later because it says that the code expires (although I have never had an issue with these codes actually expiring.)  
I love watching it.
I think Smee doesn't bend, but Peter Pan does.  
This helps to suit better.
Especially for younger kids, who would have just accepted that he and his dad were on their own.
Still if you get it at a good price it is worth it.
Colors are vibrant and true to form though, and it does look pretty good.  
It's as if someone put a filter over the whole movie and washed it out, which greatly harms the movie's visuals.
This is the second half of a two-part sequel to the brilliant original "Pirates of the Caribbean" film.
My son still enjoys playing with them once in and a while
Another good find on Amazon.  
well i loved how they came together to solve there problems.
Hunters said it was "an insult to American sportsmen.
The kids will eat that up!
It is fairly light.
the plus side this is a really great collection of Walt's lesser known works, but I was amazed at how many of these shorts I remembered, but had been long forgotten.
An underwater world with talking fish, mermaids and an evil Octopus - amazing.  
I got this movie for my granddaughter and they watched it.  
Watched this one when I was little.
The only thing I do not like is that the toy comes uncoiled, which then bothers my daughter.
so she is a little hard to understand.  
My grandson liked it so much that I purchased another one for his birthday.
These are cute and good quality.  
This is a wonderful family-friendly Christmas movie that will warm young hearts at Christmastime.
I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast and know the story by heart.
My daughter is gonna love it for Christmas.
This one seems to be much sturdier construction.
Entertaining and funny!
Its moments of tenderness are balanced with some unsettling moments (e.g., Sully's scare demonstration (scared me, too) which terrifies Boo, Boo's restraint in the "Scream Suction" device by the unctuously reptilian Randall, and Sully's/Randall's fight, where Sully is being strangled by his invisible enemy).
Clean entertainment for the whole family!
Keenan Ivory Wayans was really great
Great classic Disney.
I highly recommend this doll after looking at them all!
These are made of heavy soft rubber type material.  
Picture is amazing, and the sound is awesome!  
A bit of a damper for the birthday girl.
She loves it.
I bought this for my twin Grand Babies, wish I purchase them earlier.
Packaging was great and the DVD arrived well before the promised date.
That seat pretty much never leaks - but urine tends to collect in the pee guard and under the seat.
And don't forget all those fantastic songs!
And on a side note, DON'T pay over $20 for this set...
Charlie Ruggles, Parely Baer and other famous actors are in this.
It stops working at Scene 13.
So I thought the toy inside is what counts, and it is a nice toy set.
My kids enjoyed the movie on Blu-ray as well.
Have a good time!
Joining them in their fight are the Lost Boys and the fairy Tinkerbell.
but maybe I'll wait to see if it comes down in price at all.
My two year old absolutely loves these bath toys.
This works great for saving water in the huge bathtub.
The Blu Ray looks great with colors popping all over the place, the film has never looking this good in any other release to date.
Concept Art Design3.
Since this was made for 3D, it truly shines as a technical wonder.
In 1953, Walt Disney released a movie based on the play "Peter Pan, or the Boy who wouldn't Grow Up," written by J.M. Barrie.
I will watch it by myself with no children around even!
I guess I'm used to the action that we see in today's movies.
She was afraid Nicholas was going to get the throne.
Goofy funny with Mater kind of replaying a number of scenes from the movie in a different way.
This movie is awesome, disney made another hit movie, disney doese not make bad movies.
This series kept her attention throughout the entire 5 part pilot.
Looks like something from a Halloween costume you would buy at Walmart or target.
The film, taking place in the 60's, tells the true story of a young reporter who uncovers a scandal in `quiz show' television when he becomes aware that the winners are being fed the answers to fix the show and garner higher ratings.  
The sleeves of her dress and cape are cut into flame  like points.
love this movie so cute for young children as well as families!!
I had to purchase it as an assignment for a film class, but I'm glad I did.
The main observation I took away from seeing Bambi this time around was how much it reminded me of a Hayao Miyazaki film in tone and design.
Owen Wilson does a fantastic job as Lightning McQueen because even though he's a famous actor, his lines aren't tired and bored.  
While not her favorite, she did like it
I have had a great experince.
But these stories proved to be a challenge to not only the team of artists, but also to Walt himself.
A must have!
It was may favorite movie as a little kid and when it came out on Blu-ray it was a no brainer.
I think this is a very cute toy and it fits the needs of what I was looking for perfectly.  
We practically  destroyed them just trying to get them open.
Thank You Dinsey/Pixar for listening to me!!!!!!!!!!
It isn't the highest quality out there but it has a nice soft feel to the comforter
Anyway, get a "region-free" DVD player, and the Region 2 DVD from http://www.amazon.co.uk and you can play "Melody Time" uncensored, as well as many region 2 WS releases which aren't available on Region 1 DVDs.
But somehow Home Improvement has always managed to keep the same "feel" to it.
It never gets old and they can't wait to watch it over and over again.
I loved it when i bout it for my kids now i am bout for my grandouthers.
Disney should have left this one as a 2D film and saved people the extra money.
I really like the message this movie makes about caring about kids.
The majority of the pieces do not have bases and will not stand upright.
Would recommend for families with small children that like animated movies.
I can't believe I waited this long to see what has to be one of my new favorite Pixar films!
I would absolutely recommend this movie as a reference, show-off bluray!
One of the songs has a line stating "....husbands beware..." is that really something kids should hear?3.
And they are safe and soft, so extra nice for a small one.
Suitable second half, although first feature was made by Disney's liveliest pros, this flick is on same par with Jungle Book 2 as a sequel.
Olaf is excellent!  
I love that you can use them to create stories about all of them and have them interact with each other.
Was surprised to see that it came with a free soundtrack download also.
She especially loves the battery operated blow dryer!
got here very quick.
Growing up, "Peter Pan" and "Captain Hook" were classic characters that showcased good vs. evil.  
Everything proceeds just as you know it will.
He is all so sleeping with Mickey.
This is a wonderful transfer of this classic film - FINALLY on Blu-ray, but there is a mastering error in this version that results in two scenes being transposed during the song "Part of Your World.
Still, a great toy.  
That said, it's still very funny and occasionally touching, especially when Sully and Boo say goodbye.  
Some of the characters appear different than I had imagined them but that's to be expected.
You will sing a long with the great songs.
Women's societies can be a bit stuffy, so this unconventional movie came as a pleasant refreshment.
Finally, like in Snow White, several extra animated shorts from Walt Disney himself are included - two Silly Symphonies and four Laugh-o-Gram fairytales (including a 7-minute Cinderella).  
Looking at it now in comparison to the finished product, I can see why the folks at Disney decided to go against the writer's original film plot and redo everything from scratch.  
The story is absolutely epic, and I never get tired of watching this movie.
THis is  possibly the best all-time Viking movie made.
It works, but I was somewhat disappointed in it's quality.  
NO reason for a sequel.
I guess somehow I knew it was not going to be as good as they made it out to be.
A little pricey, but pretty average for all the sites.
I enjoy this movie.
The one with accessories was expensive DELUXE edition indeed, and the one without is just your plain Disney Barbie doll.
It looks incredible on Blu-ray, and there are many great special features included.
To sum up, I had reservations when I purchased these, and if I could have found something similar, I would have bought it instead.
Nice to see the Pre-Computer Generated Cartoon.  
But if the formula has become commonplace, it can still receive new life from a clever script and a fine cast--and such is the case with CALENDAR GIRLS, a film loosely based on actual events surrounding a British women's club who created a semi-nude calendar to raise money for a lukemia clinic.  
I don't usually bother writing reviews, because it always opens a can of worms and reviews can eventually become a boxing match for the righteous.
I think it was a great story.  
My son is a huge Toy Story fan!
This is the worst I've seen as far as bad stitching goes, with loose threads EVERYWHERE.  
Anderson also directed "The Royal Tenenbaums," "The Fantastic Mr. Fox" and "Moonrise Kingdom," to name a few of his films.
I was totally blow away by this release.
I love the movie and I love the Phil Collins songs Disney always brings magic to my life since I was very little
Basically they are something for a shelf and have no idea why they were q suggested purchase with Bucket.
Would recommend this product
However, when I opened the package, I thought the dresses were incredibly cheap looking (pieces of unhemmed shiny fabric with a cheapie elastic sewn in, "jewelery" was cheap and white plastic without sparkle).
and had to have this!
YOU WILL LOVE THEM TOO!
it held up very well and was even better than i remembered it to be.
Do you remember the tv show, well now you can have it again!Our family gathered together every week to watch this show, my children grew up with the muppets, in every form.
The same as it has been but digitally remastered.
Elizabeth ends of getting elected (OH JOY!!!)
I love the The Little Mermaid.  
It is simple a box to set the puzzles in.
First you have the Cine-explore feature which allows you to see the picture in an interactive way where you can choose between two audiocomentaries (one with John Lasseter and the other with the animators), also this feature enables you to pick some featurettes that will appear from time to time.
It's his favorite toy, even thought it wasn't one that he requested.  
My wife and I went to see this movie, surrounded by a lot of kids, and we have not laughed that hard in a long, long, time.  
grand kids loved this too.
We love all the cars and you have to have hippie Fillmore to have a complete collection.
It shows that Disney wasn't always what it is now--they were once capable of making true lofty beauty.
This was absolutely delightful and so much fun to see ladies of a certain age being proud of their bodies and their sexuality.  
One of my daughters favorite movies!
He grows in  size whenever he gets too close to electromagnetic waves.
The problem is that it is made of flimsy netting on 3 sides and it is NOT durable at all.
"Alice in Wonderland" is one of my favorite books.
Good old fashioned fun.  
To continue...I claim to be neither a Lewis Carroll nor an Alice in Wonderland expert.
Marnie's grandmother Aggie (the delightful Debbie Reynolds) is a hoot and gets into some funny situations at Marnie's school where Aggie takes up a substitute position teaching Science.
Then releases them on Blu Ray in a single box set and adds as much bonus material as they can find.
The addition of the enchanted castle was a nice touch with all of the different servants doing their job as best they could.  
As the saying goes "you get what you pay for"
We love the movie!  
I was much younger when I first heard this film was being created.
Turned it off for something else.
In the end, though, I was expecting a much sassier and much funnier movie and was disappointed the story didn't push further than it could have.
He LOVED them.
There's an 'initiation' scene that is right out of a tacky B&W; comedy.  
This is one of those movies that every child should see.
I ordered this because my original copy was missing.
but this is truly a terrible film....
I think it has gotten stale.
Which is a good thing.
I got this puzzle for Christmas for my 3 year old...his brother (2 years old) loves it too!
I shortened the string about a inch, and it made the toy much more functional.
Ultimately, I've just seen this formula before--it's too predictable.
A RESTAURAR MAS LOS COLORES
This is a must have movie to add to your Walt Disney Collection.  
I love that my kids get to use their imaginations and play make believe after watching this movie!
The packaging is beautiful I love that image of Big Ben and the shadow of peter.
Bought this DVD a gift for a family member who is a true Muppets fan, and we have been enjoying watching these old episodes from the original show.
Watching a classic Disney title is like stepping back in time.
Anyway, enjoy every telling of the Alice story you can get your hands on.
Cars makes car looks live with a lot of mimic .
Certainly this is a movie all childern (and those young at heart) should see several times in their life.
I still think that the ballroom dance scene is still the best computer graphics that I have ever seen.  
Most of the creatures are friendly and well-meaning, but there are a few moments of danger when Alice encounters the Queen of Hearts.
I do not know any girl over the age of 6, maybe 7, that would still be interested in this game.
My kids were spellbound.
I am so glad we finally have this on blu-ray!
So I had to get it on DVD for my grandchildren
We loved the recent whinnie the pooh movie that was based on the original story though.
He loves the colors of the tub and seems pretty comfy in it.
It can be used for dress up or even as a Halloween costume.
I streamed this rental for just $2, as I had missed it in the theaters, and am not ready to spend the purchase price.
I love the fact the flat sheet is fitted at the foot of the bed!  
While watching the film on one side, another side features commentary of those discussing the Lewis Carroll classic.*
We also saw another Eloise un-animated movie that we may buy in the future!
I read the reviews before I bought this, which didn't rave about this product and I won't either.
Professor Z is my son's favorite character in the movie.
I give four stars because the toy can be only in a sitting position.  
I saw this before I lost my hearing
Soon the ladies are all giggling in bathrobes as they prepare to pose with essential parts concealed behind cream buns, apple presses, tea pots, and the like.
On my 53 inch Sony SXRD I found the following: the color on the Blu - Ray disk was more intense and there was some better definition in background objects compared to the Platinum Special Edition in which the colors looked pale and to a degree washed out.  
Great movie for all ages.
Unlike other reviews I have written I have given the time length on each one; this DVD is the exception to the rule.
Follow your heart, etc.
now we has 2 of duh Skylanders Giants Starter Pack .
Ugh, Kira Knightly is unbearable.  
`Beauty and the Beast' is one of those films that has stood the test of time and it still feels as well made and delightful as when it was first released.
Great preserving the quality, etc... So happy with my purchase!!
There's some predictability (who didn't see that Ruth's husband would be a cheater?)
However, it could have been much better in my opinion.  
The 2-disc collector's edition is superb.
Belle (the name means beauty) consents UNCONDITIONALLY, which makes her unselfish choice more noble and sets a good example for the Beast.  
I would not recommend these if you want to play with them, they would be ok as cake toppers for a party.
I didn't watch it, but my 4 and 7 year old did.
Still don't understand it, but keep watching.  
Saw it so many times in the theater that I'm surprised my wife of then six years didn't dump me.  
its basically about a chicken who thinks the sky is falling but in reality it was just aliens coming and a really cute movie i think
Disney Studios 46th full length animated feature film Chicken Little was Disney's first attempt with a full 3 D CGI animated film.
I'm having a boy, so I love the touches of blue and green, but I'm sure this book would work for a girl as well.
The Beast is an excellent character, and the love story here is perhaps the most realistic I've seen in a Disney animated fairy tale, and Belle is a good character who is brave, and to whom a promise means something and who tries to be polite even when she thinks very little of someone, and not out of hypocrisy but simply out of not being a jerk.  
It funs to see how it leaves WIll and Elizabeth and Jack and Barbosa and their crew at the end.
I am currently upgrading my VHS collection to DVD and Blue Ray.
(Read other one-star reviews for specific examples of how bad this movie is).
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGood movie to watch.
Each song beautifully illuminates the films central core and adds depth and meaning and affection to every frame.
I don't understand why it was never made available for Blu-ray.
The only downside is that I will probably have to figure out how to jerry rig some kind of lace sling that I can use to secure him on my daughter's shoulder as she goes running and racing and bounding and chasing about the house.
Unusual story line, and was surprised at each turn in the movie...........Chick flick, definitely not for the guys...........Not for everyone, but I enjoyed it.........
I love that I can now share it with my kids with no interruptions.
This is a very great movie, disney at its best.
Also, the stained glass opening sequence, the creepy castle, and initially scary beast gave this story the best atmosphere of all the modern Disney fairy tales.
I had loved the books (it actually incorporates elements of all four books of Douglas Adams' trilogy) years ago, and I expected to love the movie.
A must have for any blu-ray collection
Unfortunately even the addition to Rapunzel to the bed, has yet to entice her to actually sleep in her toddler bed, but at least it makes the room look cute.
The choices made about what to leave out of the original story and what to expand don't measure up in hindsight as much as "Cinderella" or "Lady and the Tramp" do.  
The Disneyland After Dark disc includes Annette Funicello singing in Tomorrowland along with guest star, the Osmonds at early beginnings singing barbershop harmony, and a sing along from Disneyland guests at a great retro dance sequence.
I was 9 years old when it was released and I know that I saw it as a kid growing up probably 2 maybe 3 times.
Deliberate artistic choice or a happy accident in transfer?
This movie is a older movie that you don't find in stores.
Wish it was available on Blu-Ray!
I thank you Movie Mars for selling me this film.  
She sleeps with it every night!
The sheets are almost silky smooth.
If you are a true DT fan, you will of course want all the sets.
My three year old is in love with Peter Pan.  
But as it stands, really not impressed.
It's fluffy, family-friendly fun.
very soft, super cute, and really looks like Stitch.
Disney has done plenty of other stories where humans make friends with forest animals, so I guess he's entitled to this one.
This Kim Possible DVD is perfect for teens and tweens who are fans of the programme. :)
My 5 yr.
It's worth the download.  
Doc turns out to be a world famous retired racer himself, who, after a devastating accident, was unable to make a comeback and was forgotten by a fickle public.
To their credit, this is the only dress up set/dresses that I have NOT had to fix with my awesome sewing skills.
Great purchase, I love the Disney Classics.  
My grand daughter is a huge disney fan, and Alice is a classic.
But I will say that Will and Elizabeth had the strangest marriage ceremony I have ever seen, and that's saying something.
(The golden circle around the key hole is actually a button so if the key gets locked inside or lost just push it and it will open.)  
I rent this movie all the time!
Only thing I did not like was the song.
This is my third time purchasing this movie.
This product was great!
I am a Tom Selleck fan
That's way there are over 400 reviews posted for a DVD that is not even available to buy.
And it seems to be fairly durable.
This is a nice toy.
Cute design but not worth the money.
First off its more abOut Rabbit than Roo.
Definitely cheaper at Disney store than here.
To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.
Dale Beside Himself:
The girls in this film are by no means rich or spoiled.
I WILL DO MORE SHOPPING THIS WAY.
Received in expected time and condition.
We've all been children faced with an overbearing parent who spoils the fun out of unnecessary paranoia; and many of us have been, or will be, the parent who would do anything to protect our children, like say spoil some fun.
Hide that thing as soon as this is opened!
Amazon should suggest adults sized earplugs to go with it.
It looked like someone put it through the dishwasher before sending it.
So soft and cuddly, I caught my husband snuggling with it on the couch.
"Guilty"Partners in Danger Chapter VIII "The Return of the Green
We ask, "what will happen next?", as the story takes one unexpected turn after another.
My grand daughter loves Chip 'n Dale and enjoys watching these cartoons.  
Recommend if you want to remember yesterday with your kids.
Don't miss it!!!
Waiting for the father to support his son also takes most of the movie.  
Movies about children, written for children, tend to write children like small, overly clever adults.
The two bears make a deal, Kenai will go with Koda to a nearby salmon run and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain.
Likewise, in the audio department, Bambi has been given a new 7.1 Dts-HD HR audio.
This film was adorable.
Just think for a moment about what that incident says about how strongly built and well armed the East India Company's merchant ships were, and how well trained, tough-minded, and confident in their ships their captains and crews had to have been.
This classic Disney film has been restored to a unbelievable level of clarity and sound.  
Their artists have a wild talent for giving feeling and personality to inanimate obejects, while staying (mostly) true to the object itself.
You don't see any nipples or V-parts.  
My kids love it and play Tarzan and Jane all the time now!
A dolly of a film!  
Sebastin the crab and scuttle the seagull are great, but the very cute fish, flounder is and will always be my favorite in this disney masterpiece.
The reason this toy works is because the arrows have a slit at their ends that you can place the bow string in, which helps propel the arrow.  
The stunt driving is quite good.
If they are not constant & clear, the characters lose some of their realism.
The doll has a surface that appears cracked.
We'll definitely be ordering more stuff as time goes by.
It only took me a couple tries to learn the right amount to pour in to fill the mold without overflowing.
It's a personal choice, I'm not condemning the film in any way and it still deserves the title of "classic" because of it's innovative style and incredible animation.
It's a children's cartoon in which we witness Captain Hook shoot a pirate for singing too loud, Peter make rude comments about girls, a little boy smoke a peace pipe, and listen to Indians sing about "What Makes the Red Man Red."
the item arrive before the time i was told it would.if
a few days later he droped it and one of the fingers snap off.
The grandson, love all of them and playing with all and is have much fun.
If you want the 2-disc DVD only edition you'll have to wait until April 19.
I loved the Curse of the Black Pearl the most, but this installment in the series is also very fun and action-packed.
The success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs poured money into the studio's vaults like nobody's business (Sergei Eisenstein himself called it the greatest film ever made).
this item is fantastic !
I love the Animator's Collection dolls!
I really like watching kim possible because it is entertaining and funny.
I recommend anyone grab a Disney movie while it's out of the vault.
One of my favorite Disney movies, loved it when i was younger and know it by heart, i have this in my collection so my daughter will enjoy it when she gets older
I've always loved this movie, and it holds up as well today as it did 20 years ago.
What gorgeous backgrounds they created!
This is where the black side bars can be filled with similar colored paintings, to fill your widescreen TV.
Unlike previous versions of Buzz, this looks a lot like the Buzz in the Toy Story movies.  
I never really got into Pacino's earlier mob flicks, but his later-years work (like here) really impresses me.  
Too bad I can no longer find the show on TV.  
Lived the series when I was young and still love it.
It took them over a year to even catch that though because we never made a big deal about it.
You see, my kids have never seen this movie as of yet, they have heard of the movie, but they have never seen it yet.
Its not a soft stuffed animal, its more hard, but perfect for playing with.
Despite Wayne's and his wife Diane's (Marcia Straussman's) efforts to conceal the mishap, Adam, the Amazing Colossal Baby, soon swells to skyscraper size and, naturally attracted to the pretty neon lights, lumbers towards Las Vegas.  
There are days where you need a real laugh out loud, ridiculous comedy.
A lot of us have felt that moment where you know your child years are ending and not wanting to grow up.  
However, instead of talking animals, we have talking objects, formerly the staff of the Beast before the enchantress cursed him and his entire household along with him.
The drive after the opening race.  
Karate chop action works beautifully but is for older children as the button is harder to push (duh, you need enough force to move his arm completely down).
You hear a very loud buzzing every time you turn on the music.
Finding Nemo (2003) is pure entertainment; it has humor, energy, breathtaking visuals, and premier animation.
And "Toy Story 2" and "Monsters, Inc." are astute crowd pleasers that tug at your heartstrings.
My daughter likes to pretend to dry my hair and then curl it with the curling iron.
All the pieces are constantly coming off.  
After several false starts, the story finally gets to the point.  
This really is a gorgeous toddler set.
We have Woody, Jesse and Zurg and they all seem to be holding up fine, but Buzz is junk.
Bored, T.J. happens to discover some unusual activity occurring at the supposedly-closed school building.  
In "Rushmore," a 15-year-old boy has a crush on his teacher.
Especially when their obligation was to feature important news and in this case, had Jeffrey Wigand,  VP of Research and Development, who knew the secrets that went on behind-the-scenes for the Big Tobacco companies in regards to Nicotine addictiveness.
She was so well attached to the box that I nearly damaged her dress getting her out, and I was being VERY careful.
The Grandchildren love it.
I got the most stunning Blu Ray transfer of one of my favorite movies for an affordable price.  
Thrilled with the customer service!
You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate.  
I thought it'd be a little bigger, but it is wonderful!
Those of you who haven't seen this yet, get your tissues ready.
A great buy!  
The Little Mermaid is a wonderful movie and gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionSet UpA. Spoken Languagesa.
In the later books Michael and Mia did break up for a couple of years and it caused Mia to have so much emotional stress that she had to go into therapy, I don't think that the way that Anne's Mia took the break up was all that realistic to Mia).
My grandson carries him everywhere.
Marvin is still just as hilarious, even though he doesn't quite look as "Packing Box Square" as he used to.
There is also a secret plot going on at the power company involving finding another more powerful way of getting energy from the kids.  
The styling of this doll is exceptional for a budget doll, and Maleficent is the standout of the Disney Classic Doll Collection.  
Ducks of the West:  Scrooge and the boys go to Scrooge's oil wells to find out why they ran dry.  B+43.  
It is also short and to the point at 85 minutes.
In the end Peter Pan takes the children back home.
If you love Studio Ghibli, then yes.
There isn't very much scary in this movie, though.
While "Dumbo" was cheaper and did make its money back, "Bambi" would lose money because of World War II and this delayed "Alice in Wonderland" (and also "Peter Pan").  
Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the bonus features: during the "untold story" features, you cannot rewind or fast-forward the playback.  
If you crank up the age range to account for the scary parts, you have kids who might be too old to be all that interested in this type of character's story.
They carry this bag around and doctor toys.
they are the size and quality of Cereal Box Prizes!
We spent a few hours after the movie just watching those.
Much of the same stuff in previous movies, but since I expected that, I still enjoyed the movie.
We only had a black and white TV in the days when I was watching the Disney TV show, and this movie was originally 1 1/4 hour long.
Rottentomatos.com recently had a list of the 75 greatest animated movies and Peter Pan didn't even make the cut and holds a very good but not excellent aggregate score of 83%.
I recommend this a gift idea for any Disney lover in your life.
You have to wait for him to finish up saying the phrase before the next button works, which is hard for a toddler that likes to push those buttons!
Buzz from Toy Story 2 is garbage.
A pretty good movie if I do say so my self.
Consisting of seven segments,MELODY TIMEis the third and final music/animation feature released by Disney immediately after WWII.
Like Me”)
And still does every time she watches it again.
(See my review on those DVDs) but its a great investment.
My friends 4 year old daughter LOVES it and it goes perfect with her Disney room theme.
I had to open it once she finished opening her presents.
Bravo and I now hope we can get a break from changing technology...
Grain is stable, light, and omnipresent.
Soon Chris and Annie have talked several other women into joining their project, insisting that they'll be "nude", not "naked" and that a professional photographer will ensure that it's art, not pornography.
i love the nemo character and amazing everything of this movie detail clarity wow must be watch everyone
just so that there is some cohesiveness in the set.
I just ordered "Disney's Treasures: Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox".  
Swamp Fox I had seen during its airing, but like all else, it's new again.  
My son loves to play with these cars in his room, and they're very sturdy!
Ever notice that the nicest character in the film is the doorknob?Storywise, the film isn't much.
I got this movie for my daughter since she is starting to get into the princesses and I enjoy watching this with her.  
I rank it about the same as the more expensive cars seat.
Moreover, while popping the pieces into place went okay (for us), getting them out was not so easy.
The problem was that after 6 book stores, we could find exactly one picture of Neverland as a whole, and it was the background of the table of contents page so it was hard to see much of anything.
One for the movie & the other for the actual product.
Maybe I'm just blinded as a TJXSpinelli shipper.
Wow, I never really thought bluray made a huge difference when viewing a movie, but this changed my mind.  
Guess I should have listened...
It has nothing to do with actually helping hold the potty seat in place, as it slides around all too easily.
It's basically a Look & Find that continually changes.  
These figurines are not action-type figures for children to move, pose, etc.
Amazing interpretation of the Louis Carrol classic.
What's not to like about Peter Pan?!?!?  
Well good luck and a cool movie
My daugther won't play with it much, however we are not getting rid of it because I know if she gets a little bit bigger she would play with it.
I think I loved this piece more than my daughter did.
Song Selection - Featuring the songs "The Second Star to the Right", "You Can Fly", "A Pirate's Life", "Following the Leader" and "Your Mother and Mine".
Andrew Stanton discusses one of the biggest and hardest lessons he learned while developing and refining Nemo's story and flow.
Great set for the price!
We could've explored the marriage of the betrayed wife but instead, we get a clever oneliner and move on.  
I found several other of her animals pals too and will slowly help her accumulate the bunch.
And I had forgotten he had a small part in the 1950's Sci-Fi semi-classic, 'Them', along with James Arness (of Gunsmoke fame who was also very tall - 6'7"!).Parker's Dave Crockett ignited the coonskin hat craze of the mid 1950's where Disney sold millions of them in just a few weeks.
Shell Shocked:  The Rangers vacation at a beach from which all the shells are conspicuously missing; Fat Cat is using them to simulate the sound of the ocean and attract fish.  
Disney's Cars made a perfect stocking stuffer for my young grandson.
Bought this for my grandson and he just loves it.
Love it, A fave movie of mine.
I can't remember how much these were at Kroger (typically @ $6 at the retail level), but it was well worth it!
Even though there are some questionable scenes - like smoking and a Native American stereotypes -- it was still very tasteful and an all over great movie.  
Enjoy The Three Fusitives with your family its worth the laugh.
and she also liked Monsters U.
but it is really hard to find .
Woody was purchased for my granddaughter.  
Came to me earlier than I thought.  
The negative is that the script itself makes Never-Never Land seem like a dysfunctional playground.  
I love Carsland at California Adventure Park.
Buy it and smile.
A few shows slipped in some adult content so do monitor your kids
Deleted Scene: "Fathoms Below" Alternate Version* Deleted Scene:
I do not mind paying shipping to and from for an exchange.  
We have enough of that in real life.
This movie is a great tale and cute, good for all ages.
I recently had two games that featured putting together a piece of Princess jewelry as a main objective.
almost forgot some of them.
Eyes and lips - this doll has fntastic eyes, they are just prefectly shaped to give her the same look as the movie character - I can't tell the same aobut the other set.
Belle is a bit of a strange girl in her town.  
Will do business again.
I thought that this was a good movie.
The songs and sound quality are fantastic.  
While I like the movie a whole lot, I do question the story at times.
Meanwhile, back at the reef, Marlin is determined to follow the boat and find Nemo and somehow get him back.
My daughters school got cancelled because of snow and i had to take her to work with me.  
Has the original DISNEY logo on one of its fin.
You're gotta love this movie cause it's crazy what sciencist go through to complete their studies
A beautiful man is transformed into a beast because he was arrogant and rude.
My daughter has seen it a bunch of times, but still fully loves it--highly recommend as it is cute, funny, and has some good themes.
It was a good price and it came within a week.
Just so you know, I was seven when I watched this movie and was not scared by it, because of that I feel like an alien.
The fitted sheet is kind of hard to get on our son's bigger mattress, but it does go on.
Unfortunately however it is a reflection of how life really is.  
Homer Sweet Homer:  Circe, a sorceress from the past transports Scrooge and the boys back to time of Ancient Greece, where they meet up with Homer.  
Trashin the Camp: Behind the scenes studio session with 'N Sync and Phil CollinsF.
The posability is amazing, the outfit is layered of many many many different parts it is so much joy to dress that doll,It starts with some sort of kimono with HUGE sleeves and generous amount of fabric all over the place, you put it on first, then you add some sort of another garment that velcroes on the back over the kimono and then you ad yet another belt like thingy on the top of it.. and it is not even haf..
She wanted Cars stickers, Cars clothes, toys....
In this film, Penny Proud(Pratt)just turned 16 and wanted to spend her birthday with her friends at a rap concert, but her dad(Davidson)refuses to let her go to the concert.
Trashin the Camp: Behind the scenes studio session with 'N Sync and Phil Collins
Wait, there he is!
My 7 year old has non stop fun with them.
We have many small figurines and they are all played with, set up, and hold multiple conversations with each other.  
The used DVD is as clear as thout it were new.  
Also they can't move into a flying position, which my daughter found frustrating.
This story is moving and gives a great life lesson!
This is a very long one note joke.
Blu-ray Sneak Peaks: Disney / Pixars Monsters University; Disney / Pixar’s Planes; Disney Movie Rewards; Disneyland Paris Promotion and TinkerBell Movie.
oth of these men are deceased now but what they did for the Disney films lives on.
Nowhere did I see they would charge me a "restocking fee" which is half the cost of the item and deducted their shipping cost.  
Bergman is shown, too, not quite a cute as Pacino, but it was still good to see him.  
This one I bought to have the complete set.  
Even though B&TB; isn't my favorite Disney film, I find myself amazed at this BD version.
This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
You still always know who the bad guys are.  
Beauty and the Beast was released in theaters on November 13, 1991.
B&B; is a supreme illustration of what I like to call "The Hamlet Syndrome", where a work has been analyzed so frequently and so favorably, one despairs of finding something new to say about it.  
It may surprise fans of the golden age radio classic, The Life of Riley, that Ms. Winslowe played the long-suffering yet loving wife, Peg, to William Bendix's Chester A. Riley -- a fine example of her versatility.
First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun.  
You won't regret it!
This is a Christmas gift and I KNOW my granddaughter will LOVE it.
The humor in this film is so clever, so refined that is one of the best comedies ever.
Overall, very happy with the purchase.
This movie came very fast within a day
This ended up to be one of my daughters favorite movies
So I decided to purchase so my son could watch it at my work place.
She was also the only girl in her daycare with lightup Lightening McQueen shoes (yes, boys shoes - they make NO girl CARS stuff).  
Maybe I wasn't supposed to put them in the dryer.
And last but not least, Jada Pinkett Smith.
If you are looking for a better version of Buzz, then go with the TS Collection Buzz.
This doll is beautiful.
I am not sick of this yet and that is saying something.
The picture is so sharp and clear versus old VHS or DVD.  
Injections are graphically given to both good and bad guys.
THIS MOVIE SHOWED ME SOMETHING I DIDN'T REALIZE
Wigand is the whistle blower, and it turns his life upside down.
They love her.  
Fall down the rabbit hole, the blu rabbit hole!
who doesnt love a good pirate rock!
My daughter said Bullseye was a hit with my gradson, but that he is bigger in scale then the other characters.
When the objects are as varied as cars and trucks are already, that gives them huge scope to work with - and they do.
Pan" has never looked this magnificent
Kids of all ages ill enjy it.
I was thrilled to get it when it was available again.
This review lacks focus and hasn't dealt well with the central theme.
My girls love the hair accessory!
My little girl loved these minis.
However it makes up for that with some of the most memorable characters (Lighting McQueen, Mater), family-friendly humor, and some roaring racing sequences!An excellent cartoon for the whole family!
For DVD owners, you may want to keep your previous editions (there are three) to hang onto all the features, many of which have been included only on the Blu-ray this time around (though DVD player owners can still enjoy very nice "Reflections on Alice" featurette, which includes comments from the marvelously effervescent Stacia Martin and others).
Going to take some work to break them but I have faith in the kids
They also sell them in World of Disney in Downtown Disney (you don't need to pay admission to go in this store an the first 2 hours of parking is free).I know not everyone lives in southern California or has the opportunity to go Disneyland, but I hope this helps someone, because this info would have helped me!
Had a slight muddiness to the sound especially the dialog.
Yay, a boy doll to add to Barbie's friends so little brother can play with big sister and give me the occasional break!
The 2 year old is fascinated with real cars, so it's doubly amazing for him.
Disney tends to put their movies in the "Vault" so you've got to get them quick when they're released or wait till Disney releases them from the "Vault" again.
Kinda boring for anyone else.
I really love this movie.  
Basically, there are several compartments that you can peak into and find treasures (you have to find treasures that match the cards).  
So, let me start by pointing out the good.
My girls love it too.
It's only a movie, I kept telling myself...  
I was very pleased with this plush character.  
While the first film was awesome... watching Mia Thermopolis engage her teenage trials as an "invisible" unrevealed princess - Anne Hathaway truly landmarked herself here as an actress in this remarkable coming-of-age masterpiece sequel.
The comforter is bright, colorful, and so cute!
I like this hamper.
I vastly preferred Wall-E, Up! or Frozen over this...
The digital copy is itunes and windows media compatible, It's very convenient.
He pretends to act and fails at it miserably.
That whole scene has been deleted.
so it is fun for adults too.
Fun little movie.
I just can't get enough of it.  
There is a HUGE scary whale, slavery, and a million other things that make you wish  you weren't so traumatized as a child.  
I love this dvd of Kim possible it show how Kim and Ron first met and show how kim be came a superhero in this movie.
I guess it's a more suitable G movie for an older child.
This toy is of very good quality.
This is such a great kids movie!
Even for dress up clothes, they are very cheaply made and wouldn't stand up to much hard play or more than a few washings.  
She loves it!  
They are now enjoying a great Disney classic in an updated blu ray version.
but it WAY to short.
The velcro fastener holds tight.
My daughter was SO excited to have Alladin to play with her princess Jasmine doll.
He cant wait to go to bed at night
Really bad service that.
She isn't able to do this independently, but it's a lot of fun to do together.
Donald's doll.
I bought 2, one for my daughter and one for my niece for Christmas.  
My 5yr old daughter loves them all too (now that I own them on DVD).
Melody Time is a lovely collection of individual Disney cartoons from the 1940s:Once Upon A Wintertime, Bumble Boogie, Johnny Appleseed, Little Toot, Trees, Blame it on the Samba, and Pecos Bill.
But eventually after 30-years of planning and delays, in 1953, "Peter Pan" would become the 14th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series line and the $4 million dollar film would go to earn $87 million in the box office.  
My daughter actually keeps Berry, and a few of her other Palace Pets, in her backpack to play with on the bus-ride home from school.
There is something to be said for song and dance, and the Mummenshanz mimery tended to be washed out in the context of this first class troupe of puppets.
Plus, there are other GREAT cartoons as well that are classics.  
THIS DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE FILM GETTING A 5 STAR RATING FROM ME.
REALLY GREAT ITEM!
Will have people over to watch if they would like to/ Would recomend it to everyone
That is due largely to the vision of lyricist Howard Ashman, who can be seen on the bonus features conducting one of his insightful lectures.
Washes well, gave it to my boys at 6 months old.
We just love this movie.  
Everything in Beauty and the Beast is extraordinary, such as the music.
Now for my complanints - and I'll just start off by saying that these weren't bad enough for me to send the set back.
As for the reason it received 2 stars instead of 1: My children prefer the smaller products.  
AUDIO & SUBTITLES:"The Insider" is a film that is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 2.0 Dolby Digital.  
This order was for my wife.
These figure sets never disappoint.  
But it is John Lasseter's underlying message that couldn't be clearer here: Pay attention to what matters: family, friends, true love, and it doesn't hurt to appreciate cars either.
I thought this film was terrific.  
Kiss the Girl - Ashley Tisdale Music Video* Disney Song Selection*
Graphics are amazing.
My 10 month old son adores Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and now he sleeps with Mickey every night.
So nice not to have to search store after store for her requests.
The story line is consistent and does not miss a beat.
A female coworker asks Marshall if he's gay.
I've watched it so many times, I can say the characters line right along with the actors.  
Charles Martin Smith is one of my favorite actors.  
Probably the funniest moment ever is the ex-wife.
As it came into the mail, my sister was confused about why I get these.
It is a cute movie.  
It also seems to be holding up well.
The concept of the game is simple - a little too simple - you have to guess what princess the picture on the card is associated with and you either say which princess it is, or point to the princess on the picture,or 'act' it out.  
Picture and sound are on par with other Criterion releases.
It is the perfect size for a 5 year old budding ballerina.
At any rate, it is safe to say that the low down dirty shame by Wayans was giving Jada the role.
I won't since I just coudln't see myself watching this train wreck (er...ship wreck?) again.
This is definitely one of them.
It is small screen format but is so beautiful.
All around, this is an extraordinary purchase for a classics or animation collection.
To start: experiencing Studio Ghibli films can be disconcerting but is always rewarding.
The DVD  extras are super.  
I already had Bambi before on DVD wanted to upgrade to Blu Ray
Elisa attempts to find out what Xanatos is up to by visiting Fox in prison.  
I had already seen this movie before but thought I'd check it out again.
Disney does a great job of getting memorable voices with the characters.  
SO SAD because it was well priced and is a great movie.  
A must for children.
This was partly due to feeling Disney deviated too much from the original (which I was wrong about), as well as recognizing that Carroll's original is impossible to dramatize in a way that preserves the character of the original (which /is/ true).
We like this, but there are things in it that are not good for young kids or five-year-olds who are very impressionable.
The doll is just beautiful and fits in the bear very good.
This is a delightful movie.
So when I finally found out this Woody's head is plush instead of vinyl and the features are embroidered, I thought, Hmmmm!The photograph here on Amazon just isn't helpful.
This is a great toy for any child who loves the Cars movies!
My Neice use to walk around singing some song out of this movie and loved the stuffed toys from it so I bought her this for Christmas.  
"Maid of the Myth" has Mrs. Beakley as an opera singer thus kidnapped by real vikings, "Down and Out in Duckburg" has an angry fox who takes over Scrooge's house because his ancestor didn't deliver his own ancestor's marbles long ago thus leaving with family poor but Scrooge must find a way to get his fortune back.
He comes across a big castle where a beast lives.
This leads me to believe that "Monsters University" can't possibly be that reflective of college pranks and life and will be a bigger let-down than "Monsters, Inc." was.
His helmet pops open

It was the  cast that decided me.  
Bought this one and the DVD version.  
Love the movie, cast........will enjoy watching it over and over.
Purchased this item for my daughter to supplement her Disney Cars diecast collection.
This film is one of the sterotypical boy thing that I don't really like when I go out to the Disney store or Disney world.
Thank you Amazon for making "In The Vault" things available when they are needed.  
Showing off himself in The 13th Warrior, Antonio Banderas remained an unproven actor.
quality / sound quality on the blu-ray
Yes, it's about 3" but he's able to play with them easier.  
I also love "BE Our Guest."  
So, this is really a great thing to have for your tiny princess.  
I love this movie and would suggest it to anyone considering it!
What are these memories worth?  
My kids learn better with these cartoons, because it's not in their face, they just watch and in the cartoon-
There's nothing wrong at all with caring for one's neighbors or supporting one's community, but having a healthy sense of community does not preclude someone from enjoying their own accomplishments.
Adorable characters and plot.  
There is the husband - Takashi, the mother - Matsuko, the grandmother - Shige, the children - Noboru, the 13yo son and Nonoko, the 5yo daughter.
The Spirits, represented by Sitka's spirit in the form of a bald eagle transforms Kenai into a bear after the dead bear's body disappears.
I am giving the blu ray however only 4 stars cuz the transfer was far too painted over the movie didn't resemble its original color  on the blu ray it seems that they made everything way too vibrant and surreal there doesn't seem to be much of the original artwork intact.  
You do have to update it once a month with a picture and what happened that month, but other than that it has all of the other basics of a baby book.
She keeps it in her car where it has made a hit with all her friends as well, especially her college carpool buddies!
How about a most Thrilling Chase through a Labyrinth of Swinging Tree Vines and Branches or an Elephant Stampede through masses of tumbling trees and Jungles of Bamboo GrassA Feast to the eyes all Skillfully Drawn, Painted, Created by an Army of Talented Artists Astonishing and breath taken Images
But this movie is so, so touching and heartwarming - you will weep happy tears at the end.
Next is "The Battle of the Buldge" where Jamaican Fruit Bats are doing the evil deeds for Fat-Cat on stealing jewelery, "Ghost of a Chance" has yet more antics of Fat-Cat with his companions in England to rob special jewels in a haunted mansion as it's haunted by Monty's ancestor.
Buy the movie.
but I love it great movie to have got it for a great price came fast
I think there was just too much older kid and adult stuff.
For the money I think it is a great item.  
I liked it very much...watch it to hear the prayers, both the Viking prayer and the Muslim prayer that are both very compellingMuslim prayer: “”Merciful Father, I have squandered my days with plans of many things.
Home Improvement Season Two is a great complement to the First Season.
And it is quite a strange circumstance, as it was the studio's follow-up to the groundbreaking smash hit Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, released only two years previously.
This version of The Little Mermaid makes me long for the sweet, original Hans Anderson's tale of a little mermaid.  
New characters,...uh,...creatures mixed with the fan favorites; an abundance of cuteness, fun, action, and moral-of-the-story.  
I like this movie, good clean humor, and a good family movie.
If you like Conan the Barbarian, the first one not the shameful sequel, then you will love this movie.
I have always loved this film.  
She is 2 1/2 and they were a little big on her, but she didn't mind and will grow into them for years of dress up fun.
These are definitely less tolerable than the other microfiber sheets I had.  
Great for all ages.
I was thinking about buying pieces separate since I'm not sure how long he will stay in his toddler bed but I am glad we went with this.
Never saw this and I can't say I enjoyed it as immensely as other Disney fair.
This is probably the most useful thing I've purchased for my infant.
This Disney classic is a must have for any video library.
My daycare boys love these 2 movies.
On the "American Legends (1958)" DVD is "Paul Bunyon", which is also on the "Walt Disney Treasures - Disney Rarities - Celebrated Shorts 1920s-1960s"  DVD.
In a musical, songs say what dialogue cannot, and it's an art to know where to put them.
but I'm not so sure where it had ended up.
And I really hated the jokes surrounding Dory and Darla (the antagonist); those jokes were not funny; they were nasty and mean-spirited.
Although the humor in this one does not have a rolling laughter effect, it still possesses a charming quality that makes one smile every time.  
It is a movie both children and adults can enjoy and watch together.
I think thatshould have only been on a "plains" indian.
However, I kept having to call the kids attention back to the screen.
Ursula takes her voice so Ariel must make him fall in love with her without her voice.
I have enjoyed this movie several times through the years.  
In the film, Kimmie and Ron uncover a plot by Dr. Drakken to take over the world using little toy robots, and Kim's feelings for Ron finally begins to surfaced.
He loves it.
People are mowed down with machine guns and shot at point-blank range with occasionally bloody results.
I also learned Thurl Ravenscroft provided the sounds of Monstro the killer whale.
Love this movie!!
If you like drama in real life - you'll like this movie!
That was the only pitfall.
We've used it daily for about 3  months.
It actually made me cry.  
This movie is one of all time favorites.  
What better way to encourage intereest and learning.
I sure miss Paul Newman.
What's here is a charming little piece that actually (and rarely) takes a fairy tale base and turns it into a modern-day adventure with a fitting homage to films like War of the Worlds.
For anyone that is been following me for some time you know how much of a fan and my family is when it comes to Disney and their movies.
I love the scowl this plush has.  
This game should be in every household, even for kids who don't love Ariel.
Every time I think of this movie, my thoughts go directly to the cake.  
What I didn't like was one of the main characters dies in the movie.  
she loves cinderella.  
Pepperidge Farm Goldfish are also a masterpiece creation.
Love this DVD - I have it on VHS, but it was getting old.  
He plays an indiscriminate romeo paying a heavy price for his sins.
Well, it's a fairy tale, so I guess she has to get her prince.
Then I realized that when you get to the shorter months like May/June etc the stickers aren't long enough.  
Just what the other reviewer said about hair - all true.
I watched this movie with my daughter when she was a child and with my son now.  
I had never even heard of it until my co-worker introduced me to it.  
I found the animation a bit too cartoony and the musical overtones boring,.....but,..
What I love about this movie, I think is the romance, Jerry Orbach's charisma as the Lumiere, and of course Paige O'Hara's golden voice.  
then i accidently watched it one day and fell in love.
Dreaming of becoming a guide himself, he's relegated to the kitchen of the local hotel that has done very nicely out of the fame his father's death has brought the village, his uncle (James Donald) determined to keep firmly down on the ground for his mother's sake while girlfriend Janet Munro and former guide Laurence Naismith know that's not going to happen.
Inevitably, her underwear shows.
First - the flat sheet (the white one) is ugly.
What's worth possessing, and what's worth protecting?
Layering in known songs like "Life Is A Highway" actually enliven the film far more than the few original tunes that unfortunately play as cliche.
Because I was stunned at how much BETTER an already great 2D movie was in 3D.If you thought the ocean was deep and things looked great as they were, buy this 3D movie and prepare to be blown away.  
just so you'd end up buying both sets.  
You see an item in the foreground the characters in the middle ground and more items in the background where in Tangled you could see the bridge into town stretching away like you were really standing on it.
As my review title indicates, you may want to get yourself checked out if you don't have a special spot in your heart for this picture.
I watched it as a little child, but would often become too scared to see parts of it.  
After wasting his first two wishes on cheese and transportation, the genie within tricks him into trading places with his final wish.
The manner of the deaths of his parents is of course not at all the same as the book, and the story of the adult Tarzan and his chance meeting with Jane Porter of course bears no relation to the tale told by Edgar Rice Burroughs.
They hold up extremely well after close to 70 years!  
Visually, "Finding Nemo" is stunning.  
I wish I saved the box, cause I want to take it back soooo bad!
We love them, but this one fell short because it only had one or two questions for each month about how your baby is developing.
For me, it was a walk down memory lane.  
Nice for my older daycare kids and a good family.movie.
Alice in Wonderland has now released for its 60th Anniversary on Blu-ray with never before seen parts and stunning color.
These are a perfect accessory to go with the movie as a gift.
I regretted watching it more than wasting money on it.  
The forces that ultimately end up destroying those with any integrity in the movie are complex and many.  
Some ideas might be disturbing, like death, but we all must learn to accept that regardless.  
My 3 year old son is obsessed with planes saw theses and bought them.
The violence in this movie was alarming but considering the situation- very believable.
Amazon delivered quickly!
The body of water they explore can be colorful too, but usually it's quite brooding and dark.
I did it last week and got some amazing pins!
I love the characters, the actors are wonderful, and there is something fun about it for everyone!
That's where all the ivory is being sent.
There was nothing wrong with the DVD or any thing.
Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 3: Beauty Shines From Within is the final chapter of the series of Disney Princess adventures.
My son has recently fallen in love with Mickey.
old grandson LOVES the Tarzan movies.
And Then to be able to get it on amazon..
My only concern is the paint.
Honey, I Blew Up the Kid(1992) is the sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids(1989).
The man was able to produce an extremely popular prime time TV show which was little more than a advertisement for his theme park.
Some say that this film is shallow compared to Pixar's other films but I disagree.
My son outgrew his Fisher Price Whale of a Tub at around 6 months.
But they did go a TAD too far.
I have been a huge Jennifer Garner fan since I first noticed her in "Daredevil".  
Finally re-released to theaters in the early 70s, I saw it 5 times as a Tween.
Glad I could still purchase it through amazon.  
My son and I both love this video!
I was charged $40 and when it arrived there was a price tag on it for $16.99.  
My granddaughter loved it!
I didn't see any signs of excessive DNR, the film looks very good on Blu-ray.
She seems to be well made when I inspected her but overall I am just not happy and the cost of returning her would have been around $10 so we will be keeping her.  
When you are watching two kids each day, renting a movie they love is GREAT !!!!
typical of Kim Possible.
This is a great movie for children.
What else is there to say?
He is 3 years old now.
High quality - very cute.
Transfer movie 5/5 audio 5/5 and 4/5 feature.
There are 3 versions of the film included on the BD and DVD, as well as a ton of bonus material.  
Nevertheless, it is extremely entertaining.  
In my opinion the Disney company, these days, will do anything for a dollar.
She watches it each time she comes over.
As mentioned, seeing the students take some sort of final exam or standardized test that showed how much Pfeiffer's character helped her students to graduate, would have been one of the most joyful, yet tear-jerking part of this movie.  
Tim Meadows(Saturday Night Live) and Dave Coulier(Full House) also starring in this family comedy.
The story is that a little human girl comes into the monster world and our heroes Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) have to protect her from the villains and get her back to the human world.  
I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011.  
It wasn't bad but it just wasn't the best from Pixar.
One scene goes on and on showing a string of cars moving down the street.  
I have alway loved the movie and i let my two year old watch it the other day.
Now don't get me wrong, I love Disney features and theatrical shorts.
Worth it for any climbing movie fan, or Disney live action adventure fan.  
[Color, released in 2001, with a running time of 1 hour, 33 minutes.]I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Monsters, Inc.
I like that it's also an educational toy; she asks us what each tool is for, and we explain.
This isn't a review of the movie itself, but of the quality of the item.
the cards i ration out one at a time so they arnt all distroyed at once, so far 3 have bitten the dust.as for the figures, they are awsome!
This is a good type of puzzle game.  
My husband, kids and I watch it over and over!  
I love the characters.
It really looks like the toy from the movie.
So what you have is a series of vignettes that somewhat match, but never feel entirely consistent.
Sydney asks Francine if she's slept with Will yet.
It was unique, cute, funny, and different but just didn't wow
Lots of action and a story that travels along fairly quickly.  
The 16" was $19.99!
This is a great action adventure yarn for all the family.
Ultimately you will be watching a film about a Japanese family that loves each other.
The characters represent people we know in every day life and makes light of our childhood fears of monsters, from the monster perspective.
Short Order Crooks - Two thugs try to rob a bank through the diner next door, but the Rangers, mistaking them for average Joes, try to help them by making Monterey's famous cheese chowder.  
The blu ray includes many bonus features which should be in the description.
The Mickey Mouse shower curtain  hangers finish it off to perfection.
As much as some will find this Walt Disney Treasures Disneyland set a disappointment, I found it to be very interesting.
But for everyone who has not seen the VHS version, there is no reason to not like this version!  
Thanks, nice quality, excellent price, great deal!!!
I can't believe this is a children's movie.
and I'm glad I settled on this one.
We've been collecting the rest of them ever since, and we know they're sturdy enough that they'll still be around for him to pass along to his own kids one day.  
I thought there was gonna be A Low Down Dirty Shame part 2?
Teaches kids about puzzle solving and using their imaginations to play the part of a particular princess.
We travel a lot by plane and car.
Anyway, that's what "Disney Intermission is.
Other than that well quality costume
Robert Redford made a gem with this entertaining little movie.
A must have for a complete collection.
It is fun to watch as a family.
"I'm watching "Elfego Baca" right now and enjoying every minute of it.  
NOT TO DEFY THERE PARENTS.
This point is well made within the first few minutes; relentlessly thumping on the same message for two hours is definitely overkill.  
It was a throw back to 1970 shtick tv, with it's fake monsters and british hip dialogue.  
Obviously it's an awesome product.
One of my all time favorites and is on my to buy list!
This was a great movie with an important message.
Everyone should harass Disney until they finally give in and produce the DVDs.
It was a look that Disney had wanted and amazingly implemented to "Bambi" and the overall look of the film is even more impressive on Blu-ray.
I think it's very well done and pleasant for adult viewing.
She also received the Rapunzel dress up kit.
I love this movie i have loved the first one for years and then they made a second one i would say it is a must buy for the whole families entertainment!!!
And as with "Lion King," the whole point is the cyclical nature of life.
This is a perfect compliment to the Cinderella doll.
I can assure Mr. Roeper that my eyes did not stray ONCE during the film; the poor fellow must have been jaded by so-called sophisticated movies.
Disappointed in their function for play, although they look great!
Smith unloads crates of supplies on the frozen lake.  
Who doesn't love Flynn Rider?
Every female in that show is nothing but a sex symbol, someone seductive and unimportant.
My 4 year old isn't afraid of monsters, she loves them!It's great to have a dvd with the Blue-ray.
Baloo's friend, Louis owns a little joint where pilots come to hang out and relax.
Every time you insert the BD in your player it asks you to choose your language and them proceeds to play the "previews".  
It was dubbed.
I am in the process of replacing/upgrading/ converting alot of my Disney VHS movies I have owned over the yearsto DVD (cost wise).
Such a great old movie!
Turning Point:  Norman Osborn, still with the Goblin in control tries to use the Transporting device to find out Spider-Man's secret identity.  
I also suggestEaters of the Dead?
Reflects a little of life`s mysteries since when we grow up it becomes a little like  Alice`s journey.
The DVD arrived super fast and in perfect condition.
But, like everything else, it was a big hit for a couple days and now it sits in the neglected toys pile.  
If you get a pretend card,  you act out the princess on your card.
Enter Macbeth:  A man named MacBeth shows up and seems to know a lot about the gargoyles.
Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite Disney movies, and one I enjoy watching, not only for the story-line and songs, but for the memories I have of it growing up.
It's that good.
With its attentions held steadfastly to a war now rarely considered for the majority of the year, 'The Swamp Fox' is most entertaining in its subplots, where the slightest bit of humanity is enabled to show forth.
The backgrounds are also a standout here with beautiful forest settings and lavish artwork galore.
our grand kids could only keep the 3D glasses for about a half-hour at a time.
The other doll was breathtaking.
The stickers for the calendar are so big that it makes it almost impossible to write anything else in those squares.
Each player takes a tiara, bracelet, and ring.2.
If baby's not happy, no body's happy.
I consider this one of my top 5 favorite movies.
Julie Andrews is such a lady, but she can let go and have fun, too.  
She loves all of them.
Wonderful theme song and high adventure...man and boy love and mamas don't mind at all watching.
My girls loved putting this puzzle together.
Granted, I understand that this film may not satisfy hunters (as many of them were upset by the film during its original release) but for my family, as my wife and I, both have grown up with this film and it was one of the first Disney films that we introduced to our son.
I have been reading the books since I was 9 years old, just bought all the bind-up books recently so I could finish the series.
Figured it would just be easier if she had a copy for at her house too!  
I've never seen the Criterion DVD transfer which I'm sure is loads better than the Touchstone DVD, but I doubt it's this good.
I wasn't sure if this item was a good thing!
Ultimately, it will provide a movie that you do not want to turn off and that is good enough for a nightly movie of 4stars.
Shockingly I remembered most of the episodes after all this time too!
Thanks to this I can say I don't own Elsa.
I knew every song, every word.  
The film starts with Marlin and Coral, a husband and wife pair of clown fishes at Australia's Great Barrier Reef, enjoying the imminent birth of their children, which, at the time, are just a clutch of eggs.
Very good movie.
The visuals do not enhance the quality of the film; it only contributes to the manipulations and the brainwashing.
The doll is very beautiful.
The two large bracelets in the middle are the only ones with a Minnie Mouse picture.  
I was dubious of seeing this movie when it came out because Disney movies had grown to have politically correct and sterile or formulaic plots, particularly in the late 1990s.
I streamed it on Amazon Prime.
I know MY house is exploding with excitement.
If you haven't seen Pinocchio on Blu-ray, then you haven't seen it.
I looks cool.
Some enjoyable scenery, a few laughs and some good-looking actors who make the most of a mediocre screenplay manage to provide mild entertainment.
I DON'T KNOW!!!  
The animation is superb.
This one is ok but the action is not as fun or interesting
well, obviously a fun one for every family.
That's the case this time, and it's the main reason I am writing this review.
It's things like this that really lets me appreciate a film even more.  
and i'm so happy with him!
The result is an animated film that is a visual joy for youngsters, and a guilty pleasure for their parents.
The story is clean enough for any kid, it is extremely funny (I loved it!), and it is just the right balance of being suspenseful but not too scary for the young viewers.
This tub on the other hand is AMAZING, comfy, fun and great for travel.
While the animated film differs from its counterpart featured in the novels and the storyline was not as deep, it was an animated film that people needed to see.  
If you like conspiracy scenarios and a heroine with supporting teams to help her it is great.  
They provide the true highlights.
The little figures are the only redeeming part of this set.  
I bought this for my grandson's birthday, and he loves it.  
Using your remote, you can add and select favorites.
But my 4yr old son likes this movie!
This is a very cute hamper, and is a good price.
Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care.
Ariel is a rebellious girl, fascinated by the humans that live on land above her.
This is probably Disney's top 3 animation movie ever created...
The Mirror:  A magical mirror is stolen by Demona who frees the mischievous Puck from it; purposely re-interpreting Demona's wishes, he makes the Gargoyles human and the humans gargoyles.  
Pascal......this little guy is so cute.
I don't know what fabric this is, but it's extremely comfortable.
I should have stayed with my initial feelings.
It is one of Disney-Pixars best!
Will order more from you in the future.
They seemed flimsy, but my 18 month old happens to like them.
This short is also on Disney's "American Legends (1958)" DVD.
We are so glad these were released on dvd.
There is nothing simple about this film: Should Wigand do the interview and put his family in danger all in the name of "ethics"?  
Character actor, Jeff York...who was in several Disney feature-length films...plays Mike Fink, King of the River.  
Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom return but can't do much in the land of the dead, where romance is more or less for the living and that subtracts from the overall entertainment value of this flick.
the one that you will be getting if you buy from here and the one that does not come with tiger and the brush.
This is a great movie with a great lesson about seeing the world from a different perspective.
My only other complaint about this item is that it likely won't last long if it's played with a lot as its cardboard construction (and your requirement to shake it frequently) will wear it out pretty quickly.  
Another good buy from Amazon.  
We were able to find this cute little fellow at Target on sale for just 99 cents - a steal!
though they are yummy and looke like a mickey face.
It's one of the best pictures in the Disney catalog and one of the best pictures ever made.
Overall, I highly recommend if you have a Nemo lover too.
Plus it is exiting to see him stomping trough
I love watching this over and over.
Based on the book "Eaters of The Dead" by the late and much lamentated,Michael Chrichton it was in fact solidly based on an Arab manuscript detailing a diplomatic mission from Arabia to the Rus .
My family of five uses this several times a week!
I like the expressions on the characters faces, they did a good job capturing the spunk of each, but noticed that Fauna (green fairy) doesn't have glasses -- in the series, she does.  
Highly recommend this suspenseful watching.
Charles Van Doren was the most famous quiz contestant of that era.
Disney Princess Stories, Vol. 1 is the most enjoyable Disney DVD for any Princess fan.
This hat is sewn on, is soft, and looks nice.
It's GREAT to have all the friends.  
Has a few scary parts like many Disney movies, but nothing extreme.
This is going into the vault for who knows how long.  
I'd love to have this movie in 3D, but I'm really not sure I want to spend another 30 bucks on a second copy of this blu-ray.  Bummer.
When you consider that bit of information, it's kind of surprising that the footage they shot wasn't used to make a full-length documentary.
After viewing it last night I have to say it is 'classic Disney'- what the Disney company USED to be.
Race Team Fillmore is #14 in the Cars 2 "singles" line, and is one of the Radiator Springs pals Lightning McQueen brings along as his pit crew during the 3-country World Grand Prix!  
I don't think I've written a review for any of the dozens and dozens of toys I've purchased over the last two years of his life.  
DEDICATION TO ONE'S OWN TRADITIONS CAN BE TESTED IN ANY NUMBER OF ASTRONOMICAL WAYS!  NJMJr!
I Have seen the original back in the early sixties when I was just a kid, They cut the whole scene out where he ditches school and they start singing the song..."If
However, it does the trick and allows us to wash the kid very easily and he likes it too.
After some lukewarm receptions at the box office with more than a few of the last hand drawn animated films, they shut down the hand drawn animation department and went full CGI with this film and the following one Meet The Robinsons.
Just as the picture... . . . . .  Used it as cake toppers...
Even if you've seen it before, do yourself a favor and see it again!(Review of Disney's Beauty and the Beast)
Who is Prince Eric?
Pixar generally turns out great films and this is certainly one of the better ones.  
The extra money for these series is well worth it since these are played with and the hot wheels are not.
When my kids are older, they’ll get to see this one too, and I’m sure they’ll love it!
The first season of "Gargoyles" was already impressive, but this is where things get epic.
I found this on Amazon.  
I  had to wait tell it cooled off to make another that would be cooked all the way through.
Great show from back in the 90's.  
Classic line " These are OR scrubs", response " O.  R. they"A man amongst boys at a school where the protagonist (Jason Schwartman) is more interested in starting clubs and dating older female faculty members then actually studying.
I think Martin Freeman was a great Arthur Dent.
You will not regret it.
Service was fast and I recommend for any Jake lover!
This movie was very nice.
Expressing who they are within reasonable limits.  
This was really good and it was nice to see Fess Parker again since he passed on 3/18/10.
Pixar's forth film is one of their best and the 3 disc (actually 4 if you count the digital copy)
Hopefully Disney will eventually make their whole library available in 3D.I highly recommend to anyone!!
There isn't much else on this disc, but some little Disney chestnuts to toggle through.
But this one I really like.
Johnny Depp is awesome in the movie.
Grandaughter adores it.
My daughter's best friend is a bit younger and she lost interest in the game much more quickly.
Talespin has strong characters and compelling plots that make it a fun series to reconnect with 20+ years since its debut.
She loves all the accessories that come with it especially the clip on dangling earrings.
It is a great movie, but my fave Pirates is Dead Man's chest.
I tried to explain it was the same but thankfully, this edition does include some things that weren't included in the original.
If you go into those holiday toy stores, there are many knock-off dolls that have the Tangled brand imprinted on the packaging, but a closer look tells you that these are nothing but cheap imitations.
but she's just too young and/or too fidgety right now.
Now they have turntable equipment that can record vinyl to cds, plus cassette to cds also.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE!
What you are probably reading this for, however, is an assessment of the picture
Good movie, and it looked great on Blu-Ray too.  
No pun intended, but passing up on this movie certainly wouldn't be a "shame".
Really cute horse.
great christmas present for a two year old that loves tiggger.  
He's handsome yet arrogant.
I am unhappy with the purchase.
The original theatrical trailers for the 1951 release and the 1974 theatrical re-release.*
Searching for a Christmas gift for my niece I thought I found the perfect gift with this Disney dvd.
"Adventures in Squirrelsitting" has our heroes dealing with babysitting two squirrel girls as the teen one named Tammy has a crush on Chip yet wants to prove herself that she is worthy to be as good as gadget until she gets kidnapped by a criminal named Fat-Cat and his goons as this episode introduces us to them.
The villain Randall (Steve Buscemi) I found to be more annoying than threatening.  
Oddly, the set on the actual disney site was 1/2 the price.  
I think they are well worth the money,a lot of fun for a toddler, and just the right size for their hands.
A huge space saver and can bring with you when traveling.
She is a big Mickey fan, but loves this in Minnie.
It still holds up today.
Who dosent like nemo?
However because of his arrogance and his lack of respect for people in the field of racing, he finds himself friendless.
Perhaps the Disney licensing is the biggest cost in this item.
The movie is nothing but utter foolishness.
I couldn't wait to get home in the evenings as a child to watch Rescue Rangers.
Looking at it makes me smile every time :)
i didn't anticipate he'd be afraid of her.
My little ones did, as well.
This is made of cotton!
It is great to see the DVDs for sale.  
This would probably increase the sales of the first release for sure.
They watch it over and over and over again...which may or may not be a selling point.
It is nice to have a wide selection on hand.
I guess I'd say it's not my favorite Pixar film, but still very good.
Nolti and Short complement each other perfectly in this fantastic family film.
Not the best quality if you want something durable.
The bedding looks very cute in my daughter's room.  
In fact we invited over a few just to try it out.
it was a crying shame that there was hardly anyone there while "Home Alone 2" went through the roof) the second time, the magic remained.
The second major problem with the film is that is has the East India Company stretching way beyond the limits a legal authority was already controversial.
The arrow and bow are obviously very small/thin but they have held up well to some rough play.
If you're a diehard Disney fan, absolutely.
They're sharp & just like Wonderland itself, crazy!I must recommend highly to add this film to your Blu-ray collection.
But no worries, the DVD player accepts it & so do I.
My youngest daughter is obsessed with Tangled and got this to go along  with her Rapunzel doll,  She loves Flynn and plays with him daily.  
I am always relieved when she leaves the film.  
Never been a big fan of Banderas but he played an excellent role in this very exciting, tense and suspense-filled action adventure.
I haven't watched it yet as I bought to watch with my friend.
In contrast to today's glut of animated fare, back then "Alice" was like water in the desert.
Strong stitching and looks a lot like the character from the movie.
It's a little smaller/tighter and lighter weight.
It has action, cuteness, scariness, a warm story, a villain, a hero, everything you could want.
Jimmy makes a bubble suit and heads off to stop the wedding.  
But there are certain stories that have mummies, ghosts and other scary stuff in it and our 3 year old was a bit scared when watching this the first time.
This isn't done in such a heavy handed way though that it ruins the storyline.
Even as an adult, I can still enjoy this film.
Perfect gift to go along with the Jake and the Neverland Pirates telescope.  
And it is true in ways that are both obvious and subtle; a mixture of both works quite well.
Not something I'd keep them stored in unless it's literally going into storage and not out to play with.
If you enjoy this type of movie as I do, you'll thoroughly enjoy both of these movies.
Ariel's attitude and defiance, but it is still a touching story with great music, so my girls
Our son loves his woody toy!!!
It is so funny and so good.
I already bought volume 1 years ago and although I wanted the other volumes, I didn't want to spend too much money on them.
I loved this movie its a different kind of movie.
Soon they hear gunfire and they try to flee, but as they run his mother is shot and is killed.
Wonder who else is watching Nemo?
Lightning is young, cocky, self-assured, unpolished, and in love with flash and glitter.
Prefect takes Arthur on an intergalactic adventure where they are chased by Vogons, rescued by President of the Galaxy, and unexpectedly run into a lovely girl that Arthur met at a party and totally blew it with.
The item came unharmed and I am very pleased with everything to do with it.
My son loves Disney Cars and he has quite the car collection.  
I used this as a companion to teaching the book Number the Stars.  
The brush is horrendous, don't let that thing touch your hair or you will scream in pain you didn't know you could experience.
It's no wonder this is a fan favorite.
Of course, you can't get away with all these changes in tradition without something "Disney" to anchor the film and all this drama.
She can be stiff at times and sometimes thinks her way is the best, but someone has to keep Baloo in line when his head reaches the clouds.
Presented in standard definition and was included in the original 2002 DVD.  
This is one of the greats in the 90's along with bullet proof and a lot of  other movies.
This movie was very good.  
I was expecting the movie to be as exciting as the story.
We've had this seat for 2 years.
I will buying this for my library.
I can understand why people don’t like it or even prefer the original version of the story, but for me this is always enjoyable.
Bought this as a gift for my niece.
Unfortunately I feel let down.
HahahaI watched this movie when I was young.
Great new series love the old animation clever story's very enjoyable for young and old alike .
and they love it
At age 38, I really didn't think an old Disney movie could hold any charm for me.
My 8yr old nephew loves this movie so much!
The story is so good.
If you enjoy the film, but don't really need a lot of extras, then grab this before it goes away.  
but I remember back in my childhood this show along with ducktails, and dark wing duck were a few of my favorite shows.
So when it was on TV, it was cut to fit an hour-long show minus time for commercials.
The Blu-ray has been recently remastered and it looks fantastic.
It is the 3rd most quoted literature in English after the Bible and Shakespeare.  
So glad we purchased it!!
If others ever took the time to watch it they would find that it is a very good movie and mickey mouse movies are not my most favorite of the Disney movies.
he'd come to make a life, not lay one down.
It is painful to endure.
I hadn't seen these old Disney classics since I was a kid,  somewhat corny by today's standards,  but still fun to watch.  
The Show: Overall, it was not fantastic, I understand why it was cancelled, it’s your average teen-drama high school show with nothing overly special to offer.
I like how it gives a great message to our girls about taking care of animals, and aspiring to be a vet or a doctor.
When it became available on blue-ray I had to add it to my collection, replacing my other copies.
I really do wish I had this on Blu-ray (I used to have the DVD, but don't know where it went) but I guess watching on Amazon Prime is as good as anything else these days.
But when shopping around I noticed that Toys R us had them and Target.
Oh yeah... car racing fans will definitely get a kick out this film.
They do seem well make though.
JUDGMENT CALL:"The Insider" is one of the most riveting and intelligent films that was released in theaters back in 1999.  
[French Import] Sea it like never before!
The jewelry is plastic, but the beauty of it is the concept of the game and how the little sparkling jewels attach to the game.
Thank you bonus features!
I love Disney and generally think they release home video products which are heads and shoulders above the competition but to add something in one release and then take it away in the next is insupportable.
Loved this cartoon as a kid.
An imagination excitement.
Once again no kids and me and my wife love this movie.
Good clean family fun
not like some other kid played with him dirty, but like during packaging it got smudges on it.
Todays science fiction is tomarrows science fact,but not this way LOL
Already had the 4 disc from the first time around, inside my slimmed down Steelbook, but I needed the 3D disc.
Cinderella - Paige O'Hara4.
Sad at times and hits on serious points about the role of humans and animals.
It is a great family movie.
I guess that's all it's worth.
Olaf sits on my bedside table, watchin over while sleep is had.
AND you don't have to think about it - just watch and get a kick out of it.
The product appears to be made quite well for the price.  
Hes made very well and looks like he will hold up from all of her rough handling.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL STORY I EVER SEEN.
Can't wait for the 2nd one coming out soon.
They are many vendors out there, but this one is great!  
When the Sun sets they change from stone to flesh and their skin is thicker than humans but if it is cut, they Bleed!
A definite buy for families to watch together.
He pleaded with me to get the one we have at home.
These guys are real masters, I think on the level with great painters, etc.
I love the theme song and sing along when it comes on.  
It brought back a lot of memories of seeing it in a theatre for the first time.
The DVD arrived in great condition and came to me in the time frame suggested.
This is a Good movie and is actual with the ambientalist challenge we have nowI love the part when the Biologist became a mouse eater, and that one when he intent marking his territory by having several cups of teaIt must have another ending
All in all, A Low Down Dirty Shame was that I watched it.
The favorite character of my daughter from finding memo, she have to go out with dork never lose it.
The Man Adventures of Winnie the PoohV. Tarzan and JaneVI.
so, I think it is suitable for young children to view with parents.  
This movie is considered part of Old Disney
There is a wonderful and creative race-against-time car scene/chase.  
I was so excited when "Finding Nemo" finally became available on Blu-ray.  
Despite running over two hours, the film has such natural flow to it that you can't help but be absorbed in it from scene to scene.
Marlin embarks on a dangerous mission to find his son, and Nemo has a few plans himself.
I love the set: i got the calendar, photo album and first year memory book.  
I t shows that you are able to train animals when you have the right trainer.
My two year old really like the cricket.  
Picture Quality is EXCELLENT on both DVDs.  
This keeps you young at heart!!!
Based on reviews, I decided to purchase Season One first.  
The Arab hero of this film and the historical tidbits from his real journeys to Scandinavia will pique your curiosity and inspire you with hope.
I'm glad a film was made about it, although how can a film do it justice?
This is a special feat in our stupidly vulgar age.  
They did a great job with the 3d version on this.
I will be purchasing again for future trips or just for overnight stays and grandparents.
The special effects for the spirits are mesmerizing, and there is a subtle change in richness of colour when Kenai goes from human to bear (curiously, this also seems to apply to the screen area itself - on my DVD copy, at least, the screen is full wide-screen when Kenai becomes a bear, not when he's human.
very impressed with this purchase
The timing of the film arriving was perfect as it's been cold and rainy for almost a week now and we really needed to snuggle up and have a family movie night.
This was a surprise for a great gran-daughter.
The 13th Warrior is one of a handful of re-watchable favorites.  
Bought this as a gift the packing was great and the dvd plays great on a computer besides your regular dvd player
cars is no exception.
it sits in a basket with a dozen other unused dolls/teddy bears (which says something, right?).
Wore it for Halloween and played Buzz at home for weeks afterward.
My 4 year old is really into Toy Story 1 right now.
It is great to have the DVD for the car, Blue-ray for home, and the digital copy for on the go!
The effective humor is appropriate for all ages, so there's no need to feel very politically correct about this one.
AND HE'S SO COLORFUL AND TRUE TO DESIGN OF THE TV SHOW STUFFY.
It got here very quickly and in great condition!
IT HAS A GOOD, HEARTWARMING STORY.  
Sadly, rather than extending the material into the body where there would be some support/material to hold the neck steady, they end the material right at the base of the neck so the head and neck then want to constantly tip over at about a 45 degree angle.  
After ordering the Prince Aladdin Disney and Friends deluxe Disney store doll I found a holy grail of Aladdin dolls.
They were America's first family of poetry.
The day Chloe told Jimmy that she was getting married she wanted Jimmy's approval.
This is one of manny great disney movies ever I like how they used Alissa Milano for Ariel face it is great
If you don't own the film at all and have a BD player, go for the BD version.
Needless to say the French admiral and his surviving men spent the rest of the war as guests of King George ...)
Yes, they're plastic, yes, they're small, but pretty much they're exactly what was described.  
The price was excellent and the seller sent it out earlier than the promised arrival date.
She looks like Merida in the movie, her hair is far fluffier, the details on her clothing are amazing (her cloak pin is the family's seal for example), and the quality is overall better.
It's also a cautionary tale pounding home how important it is for children to obey their parents for their own safety.
They have SOOOO enjoyed our original video til its almost WORN OUT, so we were super happy to purchase the DVD version which they beg to watch EVERDAY!
I just wish it didn't have Keira Knightly.
No matter what at the end of the day, as adult as most Pixar movies can be, there primary audience and demographic will always be geared towards children.
My vote for Wes Anderson's best film.  
The kids love it and it has enough of a plot to keep the adults interested too.
Fans of commentaries will be happy that Anderson, Owen Wilson and Schwartzman appear on the commentary track.
Is soft and really white :)
And the attitude of the warriors and even some of the things they say occurs in historical manuscripts.  
There may be a few scary moments for little kids, but these are truly few and far in between, and as soon as they figure out that the monsters are actually more afraid of the kids than the kids are of the monsters, it goes away.
There's also a beautiful piece about the lyricist who I feel is responsible for the Disney renaissance, it brings a tear to the eye.
She want to know if we're planning on watching it when she comes home for Christmas.
They sat and watched the whole movie.
What a great movie!  
Of course my 2YO daughter loved it.
The movie is good.
The story is not inspiring since it seems like every one of the characters is irritating (especially Foxy) or actually repugnant as Runt is.  
Cartoons live and die by their voice actors.
Definitely have to be actively listening and paying attention to catch all the humorous subtleties, but hey, it's British.
I got them to go with the Melissa and Doug princess role play dresses.  
Chilly is my childs favorite character on the show and this little guy is very cute.
The story choices are like the Mad Libs of disney movies!
We love this Mickey.  
We will be using this for other outfits as well!Overall, I do not recommend buying it, but if you happen to get it as a gift, have fun with it while it lasts.
IT WAS REALLY EXCITING FOR HER SINCE SHE HAS THE MATCHING DOLL.
I would say it's perfect for 2-4 year olds.
That's all to say about it
Let me review both of them and rate accordingly:The DELUXE SET WITH TIGER AND BRUSHMY rating: ********** 10 STARS1.
Just like other Disney works it's great.
Goblin War!:  The Green Goblin and the Hobgoblin clash over Dr. Ohn's Time Dilation Accelerator.  
In the recent past it has been common to dismiss what was termed mythological as having no basis in fact because there were no written sources, but the tide is turning here, and historians are beginning to take another look.
The sound mix is definitely decent, once again considering its age.
Such a beautiful movie!
A mix of intellect and action.
They added a nice touch to the birthday decorations.
Boys can get excited over pirates, Indians, and mischievous little troublemakers who like to fight with each other.
Who researched this program or did they even do that back in the day ?
This after school cartoon from disney was really a joy to watch coming home from school and turn on t.v. to see your favorite cartoon show Chip 'n Dale what an awesome cartoon to watch with the family.
Fix this Amazon.  
I'm a Dachsie person , I first saw this film when I was a child and remember how it made me laugh.
It seems that Brooklyn and Demona both want Goliath to see the "truth" about humanity.  
I hate noise and I hate DNR just as much.(Viewed on a 55" Samsung LED 8000 series TV.)Audio: 3.8 out of 5.
Watched it with the wife and kid, fun, fun, fun.
Nice quality, thick pieces.
I think the artwork has survived my adulthood rather better than the story as a whole.
I read the negative reviews and so, then, dreaded watching it.  
Yes, the non talking Tinker Bell is Wonderful.
A virus has gruesome results, causing bleeding from the victims' fingertips.
Hours of FUN!!!
As with the other 1:33 to 1 Disney movies that have been released on Blu-ray before Alice, this disc has the absolutely useless feature of "Disney View", which adds annoying, out-of-place artwork on the sides of film to needlessly fill in your wide-screen TV.
This is certainly no reason to keep from buying this DVD and if you're a fan of the behind the scenes stuff or Disney animation fan, you'll want to add this to your collection.
It's definitely a "helmet" movie -- long on adventure, intrigue, tasteful combat-violence, though a bit short on romance.  
I wonder what her parents were thinking when she went missing.
Never a disappointment with subsequent viewings, just a good time each and every time!
She is a  Doc fan and does enjoy playing with the Doc Doll.  
It's no wonder it won an Academy Award!I was thrilled when I found out it was finally out on Blu-Ray - everything looks better Blu-Ray, and this is no exception!  
Well worth the investment.
We have played SALON a million times since Christmas!!
It was also a great price!
(The fear of action movie directors everywhere!  
The DVD itself has plenty of fine features that include games, Thunderbolt dressing room tour, behind the scenes with some loveable real dogs on studio lot, and song videos that have good new material.
Pros: Great storyline, good morals and lessons, appropriate humor, and sensitive coverage to diversity and relationships.
The "lipstick" broke with normal use (i.e. using it on the lips).I also have a quibble with the perfume bottle -- you can't put perfume in it!
Instead, this version simply tries to make the characters come to life, and to use the animation to recreate the feel, if not the depth, of Alice's experience.
So do yourself a favor and get this - kids will especially enjoy watching of course with you.  
It wasn't when it was made and it is even less so know with the dated ideals it shares about some of the events back in Davey Crocket's time.
I love this show.
I absolutely love this movie.
It's certainly not as good as Make Mine Music
So beautiful and creative and was reallyimpressed with the special features section.
hidden- they learn !!
The only thing missing from this release is a digital copy.
Two thumbs up!Anyone that's a fan of the first two movies should really pick this one up and add to your collection.
Unfortunately, they are poor quality & painting, though....so not good for much more than that.
This is by far my all-time favorite movie.  
My only complaint is I wish I'd gotten it sooner.
"Alice in Wonderland", the 1951 Walt Disney animated classic is probably more well-known to this current generation for the live action film that came out in 2010 but for previous generations, the Walt Disney animated classic, the 13th film of the Walt Disney Animated Classics Series captured the hearts of Americans as it technically was an impressive and colorful film.
Great movie takes me back to the 80's when I was in school.
The characters are so fun and lovable and the episodes are well written and entertaining.
She loves books just like me and we both try to find the goodness in someone.
He was living what he thought was a great life being cared for and taught by his mom.
These anomalies (and several more) aside, QUIZ SHOW is finely-crafted and always interesting.
And what they will resort to in order to keep corporate secrets, secret.
Thrill of the Hunt:  The young gargoyles meet their favorite TV characters, The Pack, who aren't what they seem, and Lexington ends up getting Goliath into a messy situation with them.  
i can't say offhand whether it's something to do with what the Breen Office and the like would permit or what.
They are very durable for a really rough 3 year old at play.
My two year old daughter loves it along with everyone in the house.
My 3yr old son loves this set.  
My 8-year old twin granddaughters are not from the Cheetah Girl generation, but they loved this introduction to a blast from the past.
The sound quality is also VERY poor.  
And as anyone who have watched any of the Walt Disney animated classics on Blu-ray, knows that Disney's treatment has been nothing short of perfect.  
Although not my favorite in the series (because it's the end of the series!), and I just like the 2nd movie better (not sure why!), it is still a well played movie with a great storyline.
I will say the spoiler on the trunk is plastic and the paint has rubber off a little bit on the corners.  
the club house is a piece of trash!!
I purchased this movie as a gift.
I found this on Amazon.  
I know how mischievous pets can be, so I loved the animals and the story, so this was a hit!
Earrings/ Head dress/ neckless - OH MY GOODNESS!, you must see them to believe!
I don't even think it is close, with the exception of "Lady and the Tramp."
the planes themselves are small and when and if you do purchases these product make sure you have a set of scissors with you because the packaging is a pain to just open and when you do have the cover off your gona need them again to take the planes out of the plastic.
The Palace Pets' tiaras have two tiny prongs that are inserted into matching little indentations on the PP's head to hold them securely in place, while allowing them to be easily removed.
Instead, his producer, Stromboli, locks the new actor star in a bird cage, and Pinocchio becomes a miserable prisoner beholding to the big money bosses who profit from his work (a realistic comment on the reality of show business.)The entire movie is great entertainment, often touching, and filled with worthwhile and humane messages about the human condition, it's follies, and it's ultimate (at times) nobility.
The extras on these sets are getting a little thin too, but what is here is appropriate for the collection.
LOL  Luckily, now that he's 4 and smarter, we no longer have that problem.  
I bought this for my daughter since she loved the proud family when it came on tv but now you can't even find reruns
Watched it as a kid and still watch it now in my mid twenties!
My 3 year old step-son absolutely loves this movie.  
Through their covert missions to bring down the Alliance, Jack's relationship with his daughter Sydney has been improving by leaps and bounds.
That is why I stopped watching everything that came out in this category and tried to concentrate on those I thought were gems.
She wears her dark blue gown and cape which is clasped at her shoulder with the brooch that has her family's crest.
The interplay between Schwartzman and Murray is comic genius.  
The lossless track sounds exquisite and because this film does feature a lot of music, this is the best I have heard of "Alice in Wonderland".  
More Olivia Williams Please, Plot gets in the way of the characters.
it takes a man (or woman) to step up and admit what they did was wrong and they are sorry for it.
It was a little on the extreme side
My 3 year was not bothered by it.
Since then he's watched this movie umpteen times--I really cannot give an accurate count, but the number is astronomical.  
I would recommend this as a family friendly movie.
he always likes to line up the characters of the movie as he sees them on the big screen.  
I love that the sets have been made and look forward to the sets developing in the future, hopefully with a broader range of characters included.
Part of Her World - Jodi Benson's Voyage to New Fantasyland (includesSeven Dwarfs Mine Train and Disney's Art of Animation Resort )*
Finding Nemo is on its way to being a classic.
THANK YOU!!!!
She follows him down a rabbit hole to find some bizarre things like a talking doorknob, a crazy cheshire cat, a hookah smoking caterpillar, singing flowers, a mad hatter, and a very selfish queen.
With interactive games and puzzles, the kids liked intermission almost as much as they loved the film!Bonus Features: Disney Intermission (new), Growing up with Nine Old Men (new), Disney View (new), Introduction by Diane Disney Miller (new), Deleted Songs & Scenes , You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell: A Fairy's Tale, Disney Song Selections, Audio Commentary Hosted by Roy Disney, Music Videos & More!
I think it is the best version of Alice in Wonderland.
So when I purchased a new Television I picked this up right away.
In the two disc DVD set there are some interesting tidbits.
IT WASN'T EASY FOR THE JEWS, GYPSIES, JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES, AND OTHER INNOCENT PEOPLE.
From the creators of Toy Story and Monsters, Inc., this critically acclaimed and heart-warming tale splashes off the screen with brilliant digital picture, high definition sound and breath-taking bonus features that transport you beyond your imagination.
Growing up in the fifties our family watched "Walt Disney Presents" every Sunday night...it was a stable family fare given the mores of the era.  
Something I would change is that I wish it had Tom Hanks voice.
That scene scared me the most.
I wanted to share the Peter Pan version that I remember with my grandchildren.  
I wish they had released either 4 volumes of DVD's with 100 episodes in total instead of current 3 or Complete dvd/blu-ray package with all the episodes in 1 box.
It is just scary enough for little kids to watch while the happy ending smoothes over any anxiety about Boo's scary monster.
Once I seen the doll , I new it was something I wanted for my collection.
This was a perfect present for a toy story fan.
The only way we could get him in the tub was to lay a hand towel over the scary monkey face.  
This is one of our favorites in the DVD library.  
It is impossible not to recommend it, if only because it demonstrates how pervasive and profound Disney's influence on culture and society were -- and remain.*
I loved this movie the first time I saw it.
It seems kind of unrealistic that her character could just walk into a classroom like that and because she could teach them karate she caught their attention.  
In some previous reviews some people had mentioned that the bumpers raise up above the water level, of course this happens - they're filled with air and a few suction cups aren't going to keep them from floating.  
While he tries to find a way to escape from his life of captivity in a fish tank full of other interesting characters, his father Marlin sets out on a search for Nemo.
but I love this movie it always makes me laugh
However, I'm having an issue with the picture quality on the animation.  
Kids love this movie and really like the story, plus a world of talking cars.
Find out by watching this Disney classic.
It has been a year since we bought most of them The paint is not chipped, maybe a couple of scratches, rolls well enough, are made of substantial metals with little or no plastic parts and most importantly are well loved.
Oldie but goodie.
Lord Cutler Beckett and everyone implicated in his conspiracy would have been convicted of High Treason and sentenced to death - he and those of his colleagues who were of noble status (or lucky) would have been beheaded, less exalted people who carried out some of the orders he gives in this film would risk death by being hanged, drawn and quartered.
I found it entertaining and amusing.
I was able to see episodes that I never saw!
My sister just loves this movie so much, i decided to purchase this for her as a gift.
Once again we are plunged into a world of witches, warriors, and heroes like no others!
This is a good kids movie for many yeasts to come.
But there are other features that MAY convince you too.
It's a tale as old as time, and song as old as rhyme…  Beauty and the Beast: The best Disney fairytale out of all their works, in my opinion.
I fairly enjoy it more nowadays, but the whole fairy tale princess thing just held me back for far too long.
What we love - the price.
You just need to be sure you are playing the game in an area with good light or it is too hard to see the picture.
The 2-disc "Un-Anniversary" DVD is a wonderful set that complements the wonderful film with a treasure trove of interesting bonus content for the Disney enthusiasts and film historians among us.  
We are looking forward to Monster U.
Buzz has put up with a lot of abuse from a very active and rough 4-year old, and is still in amazingly good shape.  
At Epcot, the Talking Turtles show has Ellen's character, and we all found that one of our faves in that park.
Well it doesn't really matter.
The material was durable and well made, I think.  
I enjoy this movie each time I watch it.  
THIS IS MADE IN HONG KONG, CHINA REALLY HAS CHANGED!
His wine label has a coonskin cap on it.
if the movie was good why give it one star?
Everything about this movie is so iconic, heartwarming, and magical.
We will purchase from this vendor again.
You will see every detail in crisp clarity and awe at the level of animation that this movie has.
Well this is a quickie (non hi-def) short of Mater replacing the sheep bouncing all over the place.
This film showcases Bill Murray's exceptional talent as a comedic actor with a darker role and setting.
Created in part from scraps left over when the majority of Walt's animators were involved in WWII, these musical montages are quite good.
Sadly we already had to wash her hair after she went through the sprinkler and then a patch of leaves and dirt outside.
Do not mistake this film for a movie just for children.
Why did they go overboad with the glitter?  
cute and appropriate for the family -
I can't really say much, the movie wasn't a surprise since I've seen it before.
You see Cars isn't just a cartoon about a world where cars are people.
Oh well, it's mine.
I'll restrict my comments to the blu-ray itself.
But his best work was on In Living Color, whereas he doesn't have the chops to be in movies.
I bought this for my grand daughter don't no if she's watched it yet but her mom likes this movie to.
You'll be glad you did.
In exchange for assisting cell-mate Richard Fisk in a few brawls in prison, Richard requests that his father, The Kingpin, frame Robbie as a criminal mastermind.  
This one has gotten a lot of attention from my kids and it's still in as good a shape as when we bought it.
A little pricey for it's quality.
She never got scared with this one either like she usually does with the Princess movies- the villains are not her favorite.
My son absolutely loves this video.  
a very hilariously funny movie.
If you have a 3.5-4.5 year old girl who loves the Disney Princesses, then it is cute.  
Well it's a very funny Disney classic, an accumulation of weird and extraordinary characters, there is something for all tastes.
It has already been dropped NUMEROUS times and no issues with anything so far.
They are entertainment for all ages.
I'll be ordering another season of Home Improvement soon.
However, if taken very good care of I do not suspect that it will be an issue.  
The toys are durable, nicely detailed, and are large enough to play with in my daughter's Little People houses, etc.  
The Blu-Ray features really make this DVD come to life.  
The Lorax is another good one.
Basically that is the cliff note version of the movie.
I love this movie, it is funny and adorable.
Overall it is a good product for the little ones, it looks nice, it functions well.
The trick, both in real life and in the film, is that the ladies in question are well into their fifties, sixties, and even beyond.
so I know she will grow with it and the quality is wonderful.
Loved the book - and I really wanted to love the movie.  
There are about 31 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer but many of them are quick.
Working on yet another invention, Wayne is now trying to enlarge things instead of shrink them and some cartoony villain in his office is trying to take his job.  
Cute talking Woody doll!
Alice in Wonderland is one of my favorites (still! - lol) in both the original book and Disney's animated adaptation and I'm thrilled to be able to share it with my toddler who will eventually be reading the book when she's older.  
It made her morning!
the racing "footage" is soo badass it Gots to be pixar.
So if you want to behold its majesty in Blu-ray, this new release is highly recommended.
I can watch this with my child or by myself over and over again we even have the cars to the movie
It's only the third time I can recall that Disney has allowed a "downer" ending--the other two are "Education for Death" and "Chicken Little" (both 1943).  
Oh it's late!
Granted, she is a little tricky to pose and her hair does get a bit "Tangled" but a quick braid solves this problem really easily and the same issues are prevalent with the Tolly Tots version (along with cheaper costume and markedly lower quality hair).
There will be those who take issue with the restoration process which removed much of the grainy look and smoothed everything out.
There are so many films about teachers reaching tough students through inspired methods that they all start to run together and become this blur of mediocrity, and ‘Dangerous Minds’ just doesn’t break the mold enough to be remembered for much of anything outside of the hit theme song, ‘Gangsta’s Paradise’, which is still one of the best movie songs penned in recent memory (and this film is almost twenty years old).  
ANOTHER DISNEY MOVIE TO WATCH FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY
Cars is one of those movies that is very different from anything else out there, but then again you can say that for a good number of Pixar movies.
With all the magic around, how can we tell?And I still love Johnny Depp, and Captain Jack Sparrow.
I love the traditional hand drawn animation but this movie has a charm of it's own that can not be denied and you'll find your self smiling and enjoying the story.
I love watching Tail Spin it brings a lot of action packed scenes and gives the viewer a reason to watch.
You know you want it, so why are you waiting?
Alice in Wonderland (Two-Disc Special Un-Anniversary Edition)...is a bonus movie I have never totally understood this movie but it's a Disney classic!~
If you liked the first two films and want an encore, you'll probably like this, though you will probably also consider that it's not quite as good.
It's sized perfectly to be a "friend" for a toddler.  
You can get them now.
The animation was Pixar quality, so nothing bad there, there were just no surprises to this movie.
Marlin [Albert Brooks] is a clown fish who, after losing his wife and all but one single egg, is trying to be a good father to his young son, Nemo.
It's awesome to have these titles give you a digital copy.  
AND it is so cute.
Another spiritualistic aspect of this film, is its gentle advocacy of low-impact living.  
Don't even think about it, just order!
Wonderful value on this diamond edition.
He is that cute.
They are true to their likeness in the movie... just small!  
She is usually a very active child.
All of them looking shamefully low-budget when compared to the likes of Pinocchio.
It will be enjoyed by all for years.
Basically, this video should have been titled Fantasia 1.5.  
Very cool soft Sulley, my 2 year old LOVES this thing.
Very Cute, love it!
some Disney purists say is, unofficially, a Disney Princess)who sees the White Rabbit and follows him to a whole new world of Wonderland, there, she meets some silly and nutty characters like the Cheshire Cat, Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, and the Queen of Hearts.
quality is great.
We had to take several breaks ...
We plan to introduce our two young nieces, ages 6 and 4, to the series.
Personally it is my very favorite Disney movie.
The other thing to take into consideration is our heroines naivety which makes many of the bi-polar villains in this film such as the Queen of Hearts and Mad Hatter unwilling to cope.
This was a purchase for a Jake fan (3 and a half).  
I watch Alice once a month and she never fails to put a big smile on my face all the way thru.
The clever and talented Robert Redford directed this engrossing snapshot of the decay of American moral standards with television quiz shows as the vehicle.
If you like world war 2 movies, you will like this one.
It is adorable and fills me with a cozy, warm feeling and is appropriate for all ages.
It makes the dark and the shadows a bit less scary to think that monsters come out to make one laugh instead to frighten.
Enjoyable for children and adults.
I know that my wife enjoyed the film and can remember lyrics to the songs to this day, but for me it was more about nostalgia and watching it again with our child, who enjoyed the film.
AND REALLY ENJOYED IT EVEN
They're perfect for little kids to watch and possibly the grownups who still enjoy this type of clean entertainment.
My grandson hated the dreamy, musical episodes.
There are much better games out there for counting and identification skills and much better games / toys for those girls like my granddaughter who love anything princess.
the quality of the clothes are quite well, and easy for little ones to get on and off by themselves.
It was a big hit with him and all his guests.
but I put a towel  in it so problem solved.
She's played with it a lot today, but for $40 I would expect there to be a little more to the set.
She will LOVE this one.
And I liked the ending.
Definitely worth the buy!
This is a great movie.
This movie arrived in excellent condition and was a special 2-disc set.  
Also, this re-release is great.
Apparently, this film is the most expensive ever made, as of end-2012.
It does not hold his attention.  
Suitable for all ages--as long as you want to completely enjoy what you're watching.
It was good for the kid and for the adults.
Great!!!!!
I will first admit I bought this for my own glinda halloween costume.
This is just filled with Jim Henson's creativity of his characters with laughter and joy.
Got this for my daughters 4th b-day & she likes it.
This was a favorite.  
(A mother owl with young to feed would make short work of Herr Hare.)
The doll is okay, nothing too special.  
DuckTales is a great show this season is a classic if you were born in the 80's early 90's you will love the classic!
Even Goofy, who is sitting falls onto his back.
The colors are vibrant, the blacks are nice and deep and the character designs and animation look absolutely cute but also its lines are absolute clean.  
I kept playing the very first scene over and over again, and it has some of the greatest music I have EVER heard!
EVEN HER FACE IS DIFFERENT IN THE PHOTO HER FACE IS CHUBBIER LIKE A DOLL.
The DVD is presented in 1:33:1 aspect ratio, 5.1 Dolby English, French and Spanish language tracks and subtitles in English SDH, French and Spanish.
The characters are just plain funny, and it reaches people on all sorts of levels.  
I and others have questioned whether earlier Disney transfers took into account Technicolor's errors, to more-accurately represent the artists' intent.
This content includes animated flipbooks, galleries, photos, and trivia.
I'm glad i bought it.
born on a mountain top ...... what can you say the movies that started it all, good clean old fashioned entertainment as advertised and the service was quick
We had one of those plastic tubs you put on your counter for our son and used it till he was able to sit up on his own and then we transitioned to this one.
He LOVES it.  
I am just hoping someone could enlighten me as to why this movie is one of the very few that I've come across that only allows rentals.
Too many things were not given any form of closure by the end of the movie.  
Most of us now have widescreen TVs, but there are still a lot movies still out there in full screen.  
MIRACLE AT MIDNIGHT is a move with a beautiful message that stays with you forever!
My daughter loves all things
The hair is perfect, easily comb-able, doesn't snarle and get all frizzy and fall out all over the place.  
Another great family movie, with great animation and story.
The voice actors chosen for the characters give this first season a feel.
Thanks to the many greedy people out there that buy these dolls only to resale them for 3-5 times the price, my three year old does not have this doll.
I saw this wonderful Christmas movie on TV a long time ago and am happy to have it as a DVD.  
Still the same quality as day 1.
If there's one thing I hate about certain movies, it is that they are too "black and white".  
Raising kids is expensive enough without people holding a gun to your head for things like this.
I bought the proud family movie used.
As a Christian man, I was saddened by the further evidences of the fallen sinful nature of man.
Another thing that is REALLY painful to watch is the Indian scene; Songs like 'What made the redman red' and the characterization of the chief ('HOW' 'Me set-um you on fire' 'Squaw no cook, only bring food') cover  good ol' 50's racism and sexism at it's finest.
In this movie show how kim and Ron become boyfriend and girlfriend in this by going to the dance.
it just makes it a little unbelievable...breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit much.  
Our little one has already spent hours playing Doc with her toys; it's something that she never seems to get bored with.
What I find hard to comprehend is why if they where going to include two version why they would add two widescreen versions instead of 1 widescreen version and 1 fullscreen version for people who don't like widescreen.
George Dzundza's character, Hal Griffith, was unnecessary and did not offer us much.
The crown and wand completed a halloween costume for my daughter.  
Always loved the movie series and I needed to replace my copy of this title.
Every day I still hear Alice singing "World Of My Own" in my mind.
It really shows just what a parent will do to help their child.  
Five of the seven look very good with two shorts looking a bit tattered.
Ready light works very well, and heats quickly and looks great in my kitchen.
My only complaint is that they did not present the lecture in full.
Finding Nemo in 3D adds a whole new dimention to it.  
I grew loving this cartoon and I am sure that my children will love it as well.
Most of all, it has a great plot- one that people of all ages can relate to.
I liked the colors on this toy
I am buying all the vaulted movies for Christmas.  
He is the 13th warrior!Thus begins a journey to the north where these thirteen men must fight and defeat this great evil all men fear.
and to make it worse the cops picked Nolte up from the boat ramp and gave him a lift to the bank so now they think he is guilty and the robber.
The storyline is cute (and based on a true story) and the actors do a wonderful job.
The story line is brilliant.
This is a terrible portrayal of females.
This is a complete mischaracterization of the movie but the movie did far better at the box office than the two Disney movies that book ended it including the disasters Treasure Planet and Home on the Range.
Not the grandkid thanks be to God, she is normal and behaves like a little lady.
That glimpse was not enough.  
I expected more from Disney.
It is very cute, durable, stitched well.  
Great story, good animation, and unlike most other media these days, the dad isn't a bumbling idiot.
Sorry to be so gloom about it, but need to save someone their money.
He turned it into a ride at Disneyland  As usual, the artistic level is very high.  
Now that is a durable toy.
Pan: Diamond Edition" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1).  
Hans Conried, as Captain Hook was Perfect Casting.
Johnny of Johnny I love ya  but did you sign a bad contract or what?
Scares capture energy that is used like electricity.  
An on-board computer, projection lamps, dual mounted trackball platforms, headlight cameras, digital readouts, retractable wings... and her front wheels have concealed guns, an electroshock device, and a telescoping utility arm --- you name it, she's got it!  
My opinion doesn't matter when the film is aimed at children and parents who love it.
It's not the softest fabric but it doesn't seem to bother my daughter & I'm not sure how else chameleon skin could be replicated in a toy.
i just wish there was a way to fix the hat in place as it easily drops off
We use the dvd for traveling, and the blue-ray at home.
Our toddler wags this around and gives everyone she can tie down a check up!
Yes, there was a bit of ghosting and some of the 2D layering effect, but overall it was fairly well done, considering it was a 3D "retrofit" and not done in 3D originally.
Before the main character, Pinocchio, achieves success, he has two set backs.
I can't think of anything negative to say about this movie.
We have it on video, taped from TV, and we love it.
In the late 80's Disney had success with Gummi Bears and Ducktales, they came up with another great idea for a TV toon about rodent investigators and heroes.
They are so cute and colorful good for our almost 2  Buckaroo
It's nice to see an early film with Annette Funicello who was a major early Disney girl.  
good for your collection of Christmas shows.
Derevko's allegiances are never really known to the audience, even when it seems that she may have betrayed her daughter and the CIA.
Except for the "What Made the Red Man Red" sequence, which veers precariously into politically incorrect territory (especially the song lyrics), Disney's Peter Pan is very contemporary in many ways, particularly in its approach to the story as part fairy tale / part Archie comics triangle.
The Vet raises Great Danes, & Dean Jones spies the mother & says, "I'd give my back teeth to have a dog like that!"
I prefer it over Toy Story.
Disney did a great job on the 3d with this movie.
The slick haired hot-shot scientist really needed a punch and thank god for that.
A big disappointment for us as parents as we almost paid $100 for this.
Only the characters in the Legend of Johnny Appleseed have any spoken dialogue.
This is the real meat of the extras.
Everyone knows it.
Presented in standard definition and was included in the original 2002 DVD.
It's rather stupid that they don't do so.
The kids liked this movie, but it wasn't necessarily their favorite (when being compared to Cars, Finding Nemo, basically any Pixar movie).
We have had no problems, I think this will be used for many years to come.
This Blu-Ray release is pretty much identical to the previous release, but this time they include the DVD version as well.
I recommend this doll for all doll collectors as well.
I don't like the Anne Hathaway playing in this because this is a Missionary movie and she knows nothing about Missionaries and what they go through, besides she is on the wild side in real life.
This would have been a fantastic edition if only the people producing this item would have given some thought into making this a superb copy.
My 14 month old is in love with this toy.
Monstro the whale can be frightening but the truly horrific character is `The Coachman' who has to go down as one of the all time most sinister beings in cinematic history.
So if your child feet is bigger then a size 13 I would not get these.
All of this supports a surprisingly funny and insightful tale of the dangers of either never growing up...or, growing up too much.
The quality was absolutely excellent!
I loved the characters and the voices behind them, were so matched.
I'm sure with practice she will get better at it.  
This is the perfect size plush doll for my toddler to cuddle with at night - not too small yet not too heavy and big.  
Anyone who has a bad thing to say about the Little Mermaid is evil, though and through.
Highly recommendthis movie for all ages.
I compared the product I received to the product description (several times).  
but I was wrong!
We always enjoy Dean Jones and its fun to see Kurt Russel in his youth.
I must confess upon re-watching them back to back that while Aladdin was still one of the best, I didn’t enjoy the movie as much as this one (although for the TV shows, that’s another story).  
Fabric looks like it will handle spot cleaning with soap and water just fine.
This is the most expensive movie ever made, even adjusted for inflation, and it looks AMAZING.
This collection contains some of the first seasons episodes but not the pilot which is in another set as i'll give you what episodes are here.
The pros are that the fleece blanket is soft, and my son does like to sleep on it.
What makes the red man red?
She loves this type of movie.  
Having seen this again recently, I'm more cynical and jaded, and didn't enjoy this movie quite as much.
That's the entire film; a formulaic story that substitutes real suspense or character depth in favor of corrosive sentimentality.
I have now watched it several times and can't get enough.
What a classic!
my child has warmer blankets currently uses than this 'bedspread'.  
This is my favorite movie.
Audiences were entertained by this animated film as it continued the visual artistry of the crew who worked on Disney films at that time.
This is my absolutely most favorite Disney movie ever made!  
You can't go wrong with this one!
This film also contains so many special features, if you enjoy seeing the works of animation, you most certainly will enjoy this movie.
Something his daughter noticed, you've taken liberties before!  
It's a shame because this was supposed to be a birthday gift for my sister.
tires with gray - "racing", I suppose! - hubcaps.  
Mixed feelings about this lovable bad guy.
yet so it holds up well.
She gets it out when we watch the show and sometimes acts out part of the show when we review the episode at the end.
They make me smile every time I watch it.
The jokes about them are not the sort that would be acceptable today.
The remaining features include a song, an interactive game, TV specials and reflections on the film.
She loves it.
moms can b a ideut sum tim.
The extras are a must have for Disney or movie buffs.
Seems well made and has not melted, although it has not yet experienced suuummmerrr....
Let's be honest, this is about as close to an unfilmable property as it gets.
What kept me coming back?
I watched them everyday after school.
More suitable for girls 3 or even 4 and up and If they can really take care of her.
Over the next two decades, he took - not only the film world by storm - but he shook up the Broadway musical world as well.
This is something that I need to remember as I work with my children.
Glad we have it to enjoy over and over.  
Dad rescues boy, then apologizes to son for being too strict.
There are men with bear skins on that attack a village, and the arab Antonio Banderas is the 13th warrior who now has to take on other peoples fight, but he learns alot and adds a lot of info to the victory
I seen this when I was a child and remember the little chimps picking their olives.  
The Disney Renaissance was truly flourishing at this point, although personally I think it actually started a little earlier than most people think (specifically, with the Gummi Bears show which lasted 6 seasons & The Great Mouse Detective).  
In other words it wasn't simply in the imagination of Wendy, John and Michael but was an actual location they flew to just not a place you could ever stumble across.
And yes, we are very cautious when it comes to the safety of our baby.  
He is just a one-dimensional bad guy.  
This is a weird movie about a boy trapped in a bubble due to his lack of immune system.
It is an unaltered version of the movie and includes some deleted scenes and songs plus more special features.
it was GOOD item!
My grandson loved this collection as a Christmas present!
Michelle Pfeiffer really surprised me with her acting abilities in this movie.  
She still loves the doll, but like all dolls, when being played with by a toddler the hair doesn't make it too long before it's all over the place.
Had a family Movie night and this was a total hit.
Being from the 60s, it really fits in with his persona of the time, in my opinion.
"The Insider" focuses on Jeffrey Wigand.
When Belle realizes this, she offers herself in exchange and what begins as a tormented relationship slowly begins to evolve.
Given thirty days to bring his financial house in order, Dean Higgins discovers that the college science class has come up with an enhanced breakfast cereal that makes one immensely strong.  
From deer and rabbits to skunks and chipmunks, they are here!  
My son who has ocd loves this movie.
She is such a monster but somehow likable until the end anyway.  
When Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes) a bright, attractive college instructor came on the show, the producers decided it was time for Herb to lose; he did and Van Doren became the biggest thing on television, even making the cover of Time Magazine.  
Anyone who knows the story remembers it as a heartfelt, albeit heartbreaking at times, story.
It's a great classic that never gets old.  
I already have season two volume one .
It's such a great older movie.
The Money Vanishes:  The Beagle Boys steal Gyro's handheld teleporter and use it to steal Scrooge's fortune.  B12.  
The extra features in this set are substantial and very interesting.
Actually broke is not quite correct.  
One of the first Disney movies I can recall seeing, back in the day, still LOVE it !
On the other hand we have the scene where Jack Sparrow is spinning around The Flying Dutchman like a video game character and the one where a flaming Jack the Monkey is shot from a cannon and I can't help but slap my palm against my forehead.  
This is a tale of an Arab man's journey through an adventure with a group of Vikings.  
This is a yes for my DVD collection.
It solves the mystery that plagues all kids...
Every family should have this movie on hand for their children and grandchildren.
(If it was humanly possible, I would, too).Rebecca Cunnigham comes to own Baloo's Air Service and turns it into Higher for Higher.
The other set, Pluto did not last long.
But I want to alert those without DVD Players that - like Destino and other great material on the Fantasia/Fantasia 2000 release in December, there is NO BONUS material on the DVD copy included in this combo pack.
There are many funny spots but a few gags that go a little too long.  
Not a smart business decision when you're trying to compete with Netflix.
I like this move because it shows how you can teach anyone even ones who have problems.
My 3yr-old daughter LOVES this doll.
We purchased this 3D version from Amazon and it is a legit legal copy, not burned or homemade.  
This is the movie where things kind of fell apart, just like in the last Matrix film, or whatnot.
The game has some resemblances to the older game Pretty Pretty Princess, but is very different in how it is played.
This is my favorite Pixar film, and I hate fish so that says a lot.
I already knew this movie was great, but it was nice to be able to find it on Amazon for a good price and watch it again!
If you want more fancy go with limited edition but if you want just for play then this will do.
My son can truly be rough on his toys but he LOVES buzz so he's very gentle with it.
A hidden gem of a Disney live action movie!  
Scripting is, as is expected of the Disney/ Pixar machine, quite polished.  
Please understand that the film is very close to my heart so it is hard for me to be objective.
Love Disney products the quality, graphics, design always amaze me they have wonderful imaginations.
It's a nice looking hamper and conveniently folds to be put away if needed.
It's to get one to purchase the accessory pack.
From the extended Multiplane sequence that pulls us into the depths of the forest, to the breadth of the meadow on which the deer gambol, the artwork is not merely a background, but a devotional act of "love of Nature".
One might say the heart and soul of The Muppet Show was the running gag, spread out over all 22 episodes.
This is the best of the few episodes that focus on Chip.  
Would be a great gift idea!
Just absolutely terrible when the writing is resorted to reused quips.  
101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure is a 2002 Disney direct-to-DVD feature film and the sequel to the 1961 Disney classic.
They are pretty difficult to balance and they normally just topple over.  
There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much.  
An excellent episode focusing the relationship between Chip & Dale.  A+42.  
How she didn't know Tinkerbell started in a different movie then the ones about her had to be corrected!
My daughter plays with this everyday!
Destiny by makeover?
The cake looked great and now she won't put down her guys.
That and the overall quality of Micky and the Beanstalk are what keeps me from giving this a 1 star review.
Here we meet Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb.
The disc ends with fireworks around Rivers of America.
I can only imagine what a child might infer from it, and it diminishes the overall message of the story.
Luck O’ The Ducks:  After finding a leprechaun in his cargo, Scrooge is led to Ireland, where he believes that he'll find a vast fortune of gold.  
Every action we take can have an effect on someone else.
Since these reviews are all identical (down to the typos), my guess is that is is a 3rd party vendor who is trying to sell the previous version.
This doll went to my darling granddaughter and she loved it.  
The DVD arrived on time and at a terrific price.
The Halloweentown students are disguised as humans so that they don't scare off the humans, and there's even a love interest storyline featuring Marnie's budding romance with Cody.
The body is too full in some places and empty in others.  
Max befriends Herman Blume (Bill Murray), who is a wealthy tycoon and former student of Rushmore.
Very sturdy, soft, and with his posable legs and comic face, I was glad we got him.
Steve Ramm"Anything Phonographic"
In November 2012, a Federal Judge Gladys Kessler ordered that tobacco companies publicly admit through advertisements and package warnings that they deceived American consumers for decades about the dangers of smoking.
My 2 year old right now is walking around with it over her head all the time as she can see through the mesh sides :).  
It's one that I have watch more than once and plan to watch more than one again in the future.
Often the style actually gets in the way of the drama, vies for the viewer's attention and only adds to the film's length rather than adding to the mood.
Well, the movie manages to put the characters in these situations, while keeping all of the charm one should expect from Winnie the Pooh.
A must own!
but she really enjoyed it.
The girl who plays Eloise is wonderful.
It holds water and take awhile to dry.
You will find yourself singing to songs such as "Beauty and the Beast", "Be Our Guest" and "Belle" and the truth is, the music captivated many people in 1991, so much that it won an Academy Award for "Best Music, Original Score" and "Best Music, Original Song" and also won two Golden Globe Awards as well for its score and for "Best Original Song - Beauty and the Beast".
At 1080p it is definitely noticeable.
tons of fun.  
Then maybe they'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.
This time Marnie has put together a program to try and bring the human world and the monster world together, with her family's magic on the line.
I'm shocked at the negative reviews.
Never before have I seen an animated film that could show facial expressions on a creature that look so human-like and believable.
The blue ray presentation is excellant with all the trimmings which include the 3-D version of the movie.
This made-for-TV Disney animated feature is one of the few.
They can still remove it, but at least it stays on during play time.
The artwork is highly regarded by artists and although not realistic, you get a feel of a painted style, a brilliant artistic use of paint in animation brought to Disney's attention courtesy of Tyrus Wong.  
I loved it the first time in regular digital and absolutely loved it in blu-ray.  
Nevertheless, this film helps shed some light on two of the individuals who were actually hunched over the drawing board.  
Just a beaut movie.
It is not.
The colors are superb!  
This is a great doll for your money, but please be aware when ordering as there are many other Tangled dolls out there not made by Disney.
A very funny take on closet monsters.  
Although this movie was panned when it was released it is a Disney movie and is necessary to keep my Disney collection complete!
Overall, I understand it's definetly one of Disney's greatest films for good reasons.
Loved this series as a kid and we have now introduced it to our 8 year old son.  
But what makes Rushmore a favorite for most are the characters.
About as spot on with the films as you can get.  
You can't miss with this!  
My 3-year-old loves Mater's tall tales and asked for monster truck Mater for his birthday.  
Makes the plot so interesting, Johnny Depp is still as funny and classic as he was in the previous ones.
I've never had a bad experience on Amazon before - but this sucks.
I have rented this more than once.  
Both movies were written with Owen Wilson, and they have a similar feel.
I might keep it and get my grand-daughter another one.
He wants to watch it every day.
Basic plastic, thick not too sharp.
Really throws off the flow.
The backgrounds are simply amazing and the characters are so well drawn that you have a sense of reality that not many animated films had.
I spent 20 bucks for the pack.
Great fun movie.  
What a classic!
This is really a steal for the three disc set.  
It's a great family film.
Not really what I was expecting.  
Both the video and the sound on this BluRay are state-of-the art.
It was so easy to just fill out one square when something extraordinary happened (clapping for the first time, smile, first tooth, trying a new food).  
This Disney classic has some of the prettiest animation I've ever seen, plus top notch songs and characters.
However, this is another fine upgrade over previous releases.
Then maybe they'll see that even the little guys can make them a profit again.
should be a longer series.
Belle is clearly the greatest of the Disney Princesses - plucky, great voice, brave, and looks better in a ballroom than even Cinderella in her Fairy-Godmother-enhanced dress.  
I love this movie.  
Beware - there are some smaller pieces (bracelets, etc.) that can get lost or may present a choking hazard if you have other younger children.
trying to get all the Disney movies as soon as they are released on Blu ray
I can visit them anytime I pop a disc in my DVD player.
Otherwise, it is totally undistinguished: hackneyed, false, and tasteless.
I recommend to all people of all ages.
I could watch this movie once a week.
I wish they had more like this that aren't Disney princess--we got it as a gift, and she doesn't even know who any of the characters are, because I'm not a huge Disney fan.
its excelent quality, adnd looks same equal to the movie, my daugther plays for long time while watch the movie in blue ray player
So you get stuck buying a mediocre toy with a hint of greatness, instead of a fascinating spectacle like the talking Buzz Lightyear.
It's worth buying if you only have it on video, but I wouldn't bother upgrading to blu ray if you have the DVD version.
One of the greatest Disney classics ever made.
Without any real challenge to the game it is just reduced to more plastic for dress up.
I think I was expecting maybe 5-6'')  
Worth the price.
Cars BD is magnificent.
It's definitely worth watching for kids, especially fans of the show.  
It looked like a used product, and I don't think it will last very long before I have to pitch it.
I've enjoyed Alice in Wonderland since I was a kid, long before I could even begin to appreciate the hidden meanings and double entendres you'll find as an adult.
Fun movie about women stepping beyond the confining paradigms of a conservative society and world.  
I did not think that my son was ready to transition to the big tub yet.
Don't pay a ton of money for them.
Face expression is just like the doll from the movie.
movie can be slow and i really tire of the dolphin intro, which takes forever, but this is a cool movie.  
Also featuring great songs like "You Can Fly" and "Following The Leader,"  Walt Disney's "Peter Pan" is one of the golden masterpieces from the company.
so now I need to seek alternatives or be very careful.
And what do you know, I'm still thinking that.  
We have several pillow pets and this was a great addition.
For the first time ever, through the magic of Blu-ray, fully immerse yourself in the stunning underwater world of Disney's Pixar's Finding Nemo.
Tinkerbell's light gets stronger and she is healed by the power of the children's belief in fairies.
Velvety soft and super cute, great product!
The action sequences are good, especially when combined with the superstitions rife at the time.  
Worthwhile animation and good storyline ----- clever and creative.
"I'm going to be late...very late" is a quote from Alice in Wonderland that I think I have heard almost all my life.  
We saw this on NetFlix and absolutely had to buy it so we could see it again and again.
The best Pixar movie, period.
Some of the pieces either aren't painted or have color that's been chipped off.
I'd recommend it
This dvd is wonderfully mastered with great color sound and visuals what a fun movie for all ages Buy it
My DVD came in the mail on Thursday August 1,2013 and I have watched it the day it came and I had no problems with the DVD at all Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!!!!
The sheriff is awesome.
Well worth the extra expense.
This stuffed toy is made very well and perfectly matches the character from "Frozen"  The stuffing is just right--not too tight and not too loose.  
In 'Top Duck,' we meet Launchpad's family.
My main issues with the seat though are that it:1 - had nothing to click it/stick it on the seat to keep it in place2 - sinks down under the weight of my 21 lb girl3 - I can see my own hands getting unsanitary from touching the seat to open and close it after being on the toiletI think it's a great idea, but not a well developed/made product to do the job it's supposed to do.
They are a lot of fun.  
To let you know, the animated romance is my artistic specialty and "Bongo" is one of them.
Nothing a little hot clue and some ribbon can't fix.
A little wooden boy doing "bad" things that really are bad.  
This episode si what I love about the Rangers; how they help people out.  
um..well maybe one small thing it's not a big deal but the disk are not in widescreen as I hoped unless my blu ray settings are wrong the film disk and special feature disk seem to be in full screen only let me know if I'm not playing it right or need to adjust my blu ray settings, lol but over all just an Amazingly Sharp picture and a fun film.
Santa brought this cutie to my 3yr old daughter last Christmas.  
So....DVD #2: "DAVY CROCKETT & THE RIVER PIRATES" was the logical follow-up.  
I highly recommend this movie.
Much of the film is devoted to the techniques of the naturalist, for example, the examination of scat from animals, to determine their diet, the behavior of animals in using their urine to mark their territory, and the parental instincts of wolves towards their young.  
Beauty is really small, standing at less than 3 inches tall at her highest point.  
I grew up watching this show since i was 5 when it came out in 1987 as it was one of my fave cartoons of that time with Real Ghostbusters, Transformers, Thundercats, GI Joe, He-Man, Rescue Rangers, She-Ra, Gummi Bears, Voltron and more.
But, still great fun.
Jiminey Cricket ends the movie (the incredible, lilting, haunting voice of "Ukelele Ike" Cliff Edwards, the voice of "Jiminey Cricket") with the simple song "When You Wish Upon A Star" and a final portrait of the lovely star lit night time sky casting it's friendly light over the small Swiss Italian village.
Annie begins to feel that the business side of the project and its success has made Chris less concerned about the actual point of the project; Chris accuses Annie of being a self-indulgent martyr.  
And for Disney, there classic animated films are expected to be fantastic releases and fans expect nothing lower.
Political correctness is for monkey-butted sissies.
Watched this when boys were small.
This another film I had seen when it first came out and was one of my favorite of Disney films, There really was some good Philosophy in it."Yesumm
Alice is a delight!
My daughter read the Rosemary Wells book Max's Beauty Shop and so this toy was the perfect accompaniment to that fun story.  
My kids love this movie especially my son who is 7 years old.
Especially considering he talks and has a few moving parts!  
Funny at times corny.
She LOVES this tub!!
Absolutely charming story.  
I watching with my wife.
I guess "never judge a book (or movie) by it's cover" held true here.
I was halfway through the season and Amazon removed it from prime.
It is one of the best purchases I made!  
Certainly helped catapult Jennifer Garner right into stardom.  
This plush is so adorable.
And while Ducktales has good guest characters, few are as awesome as ones that the other shows bring in on a regular basis.  
I took Merida out of her box, but as an adult collector, I will display her on a stand to keep her looking nice.
You know, just don't have a cake at all, how's that?I'm sorry.  
One of pixar's best movie..
Koda's not just cute, he commands the scenes in which he appears and directs the emotional pull of the story.
Good Christmas movie starring Julie Andrews, who is always a great actress and singer.
In Eloise at Christmastime, precocious 6-year-old Eloise (Sofia Vaissilieva in a wonderfully exuberant performance) plays matchmaker.
All of the other product reviews claiming poor quality were right.  
The kids love his goofy smile and they just crack up playing with him.  
They didn't need anything fancy to tell a good story.  
Had this on VHS and my dog destroyed it.  
Everything still works and she still loves pretending to clean just like mommy now that she is 3 .
We watch it often!
So many important life lessons to be learned here...things like "If you can't say something nice don't say anything at all."  
When Disney does it they really go all out!  
It has gone everywhere with us over the last couple of days.  
Keeps them smiling all day.
The kind of toys we had when we were young.
but really it's nothing more than a decorated box and a smaller than I anticipated box.
they are young and the story line is really good.
I have read some low reviews for some of the other brave dolls so my note to anyone looking, spend the extra couple of dollars and get this one.
Ariel's arms and legs are jointed so she's poseable and her mermaid fin skirt can be removed and you can put other Barbie clothes on her.
I rent it and he watches it over and over.
I bought these for my daughter's Tangled birthday cake.
Like all classic Disney movies, the pace is considerably faster than movies today, but I like it this way.
I liked it!
Davy Crockett good memories.
But overall, "Alice in Wonderland: 60th Anniversary" is an amazing Blu-ray release.  
The episodes on Volume One are:Disc One:Plunder & Lightning - Pilot Part OnePlunder & Lightning - Pilot Part TwoPlunder & Lightning - Pilot Part ThreePlunder & Lightning - Pilot Part FourFrom Here to MachineryIt Came From Beneath the Sea DuckTime Waits for No BearMommy For a DayI Only Have Ice For YouDisc Two:Molly CoddledPolly Wants a TreasureVowel PlayStormy WeatherBearly AliveHer Chance to DreamAll's Whale That Ends WhaleThe Golden Sprocket of FriendshipDisc Three:
A more enlightened culture consciously decided to treat Native American's with more reverence particularly given the raw deal they been dealt since European's appeared on the shores of the new world.
Obviously my 3 year old didn't want this so Doc no longer wears her hair band.  
Then we have "Prehysterical Pet" has an alien dinosaur that crash lands on Earth befriending Dale as the others must try to find his spaceship-egg to get back home, "Robocat" is preciously what you think it is about a mouse-exterminating robotic cat that gets a heart of gold as it must try to bring back a rich boy's fish back from Fat-Cat and finally "Does Pavlov Ring a Bell?" is about a lab rat that Gadget falls for until she learns his secret.
Sulley and Mike's careers at Monsters, Inc. and the very welfare of Monstropolis are in jeopardy once Sulley accidentally lets a human child into the monster.  
Lots of different types out there.
just so I could wrap it for his birthday.
This Latso comes w/o a box and has no real "strawberry smell" but he does smell faintly of something thouh).
The final story is another fully animated feature with Jasmine and the rest of the gang attempting to cheer up a bratty unhappy boy king who's mood determines the state of his kingdom.
Years ago Kurt Russell was the Disney darling that had many movies kinda based at this fictional college called Medfield.
Basic Disney DVD construction.
Don't know if dimensions were included in description.  
Thank you for having this available.  
This movie has a good story but the way they present it is not the best.
They are well made and are much easier to hang than streamers!
A fun movie in 3D that didn't cost an arm and a leg.
There is a skull looking cave and some scary stuff getting to Christopher Robin.
Buy this tub!
Yet it was fun to watch.
But the bad guys show up and it loses some steam for me.
A REALLY, REALLY cute movie about school with similar problems as regular schools.
This is the Blu-ray version of the first Cars movie from Disney.
Good clean fun with adorable characters.
Worse, Doofus joins him on his trip, the pair accidentally causing the Martians to attack Earth.  
Michael Mann is a very precise and demanding filmmaker, and I imagine the transfer must have met his approval before making its way onto this Blu-ray.
it was too long and did not hold my interest
"The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up") would be featured in a stage play in 1904, to be followed by a novel titled "Peter and Wendy" in 1911.For a  young Walt Disney, "Peter Pan" was one of Disney's favorite stories growing up and back in 1935, he originally intended for "Peter Pan" to be the second Disney animated film after "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".  
This is my favorite Disney movie from childhood.
It has a good story about a family involved in WW2.  
When films are made like this, that passion is completely contagious.
it's also kind of rare now.
Looks cute on his bed!
They have SOOOO enjoyed our original video til its almost WORN OUT, so we were super happy to purchase the DVD version which they beg to watch EVERDAY!
As another reviewer noted, I'd venture that females will find this film more entertaining than most males and Dame Andrews (DBE) does indeed get the British accent spot on. :D
I absolutly love this movie, its funny its touching its perfect, it doesnt matter how many times ive seen it, it still makes me love it more and more would recommend to anyone, pixar does such amazing movies.
It looks fantastical on bluray.
I didn't see that.
I am a very spiritual woman and this is a very spiritual movie that has very true facts in it but gives it to you in a fun way for a child to understand and be entertained by it.  
In the end Tarzan gets an AAAAA+++++.DVD FEATURESChapter SelectionBonus MaterialA.
Love the adult enjoyable / kid understandable humor!  
I'm afraid puzzle will not last long with a 3 yr old; dropping, stepping & throwing...wish product would have been cheaper for the quality.
She's great for kids too.
Entwined with the high-tech equipment and spying missions is a futuristic sci-fi theme tied to the artifacts of a 15th century prophet.
It's the lesser of the 2, but it's still good.  A-9.
The voice cast, once almost completely well-known to the world at large, now fits the characters better than ever--and have become iconic on their own.
My daughter seen this doll at target and wanted it so bad.  
Granddaughter loved it and it is small enough to carry with her in a pocket or backpack.
I just think it's too big to lack such definition.
They pieces are made well & I know will last forever.
Wistful, sad, imaginative, it depicts an unusual friendship between a precociously advanced teenager and a terribly childish adult.  
Also, the smallest ones may need some assistance popping jewels in and out.
I own this movie from when I was a kid, and my kids love it.
And I was right.
I like it a lot compare with those plastic baby bath tub.
Gangsters chase him around.
I would give it 3 stars for cost.
For one, how close the animators were in capturing Kathryn Beaumont's mannerism and movements via the live tapings that were done of her back then.  
One of my favorite Disney movies!
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is undoubtedly my favorite film of all time.
Disney's Mambo No. 5 Performed by Lou BegaIV.
This is one of the newer Disney classics!
I went looking for it.
I loved this movie...
The Thirteenth Warrior is one of my favorite movies.
If (and I have little hope)
If the name "Phil Silvers" rings a bell, you will want to see it just because of him!  
Norrington is back in the Navy, and the only reason I liked this movie remotely more than the second one was because Barbosa was in it, and as I said, he is my favorite character.
What these optional notes mean is that you will be sure to get at least two viewings, one without notes, and one with.
My daughter loves it, and it has held up well with all the rough play she does with it.  
This is one of my favorite animated films and is definitely one the whole family can enjoy.
This is a 'precious' item in our house!  
There are other places I could go on about, but that gives you the idea.  
Nor am I a fan of the voice talent of this character.
I was angry when this arrived cause I know I was searching for DVDS Used not VHS How I ending up purchasing the wrong format gets my angry and I have no way to play it because I got rid of my VHS.
I am very happy i bought this movie.
The kids should be very entertained.  
She is British, so therefore Alice was too, and I just LOOOVE British accents!!!Walt Disney himself would go on to call this film a disappointment, taking away from the family oriented nature of his other films.
I love all of the Pirate movies and I am glad that I bought this one to add to my pirates collection!
This is a movie to have.
Instant classic when it was originally released in theaters, and now I can watch it whenever I want!
Yes it's about aliens, but it's got a pretty funny twist ending.
I actually liked Antonio Banderas in this, normally I don't care for him (except in Mask of Zorro).  
This is one of those dolls that appears much more attractive on the picture then in real life.
This is a great episode with a wacky invention that's actually very cool.  A4.
I have no problem dumbing down my expectations for a movie that wasn't even aimed at my age group to begin with (I am 23
Great quality and large pieces for fun.  
If you do buy, invest in some bobby pins.
My 4 year loves this movie, I'm thankful I was able to stream it and keep him quiet so I could take a (well needed) 5 minute shower.
but I ended up using them for decorations instead since her cake already had princess figurines on it.
2) He is hard to move around the floor because the wheels underneath him are tiny and flimsy.  
We bought several Doc McStuffins items...the Doc Kit (love it!)
A favorite movie from my childhood, and I'm glad to finally see it on Blu-ray.
question mark hanging over their heads.
A Stunning underwater adventure with unforgettable characters, funny, and heartfelt emotion as we watch the journey of an overprotective clownfish named Marlin, and his son.
His venture proves to be a life-changing experience.
I saw this movie a long time ago.  
YoutubeNo one will care...
2 things really bother me about this particular doll.  
Our three year old grandson loves him.
The Tigger MovieSet Up1) Spoken Languagesa.
I have expensive dress up gowns that are each more than this set and durable but these are great, Mommy won't have to help her dress!!
Not a great script but very good acting.
Alice is a quite proper little English girl whom most assiduously seeks to always do the right and  virtuous thing  as opposed to the anarchy that surrounds her as she makes her way thru Wonderland.
The poor diminutive fowl is reluctant to even attempt to explain it a second time considering he hadn't even lived down his first lapse in judgment.
Charles S. Dutton was actually good as the deceptive DEA agent Sonny Rothmiller and Andrew Divoff as Mendoza was intimidating and charismatic.
It's the best.
I am VERY happy I bought this DVD!!
Rather than trying to appear as one of the intelligentsia, allow me to offer you one bit of advice: buy it!
She's 15 years old now, but when I found it on Amazon, I thought I'd surprise her with it!
Yes, it is based on actual events, but so are the countless other films following this formula and so it begs the question, why tell more than one of these true stories?  
"Merit-Time Adventure" has the Junior Wooducks especially the lovable Doofus (Voiced by Brian Cummings) and new to the club Webby Gale with Uncle Scrooge and Launchpad who go to a island for adventure thus to discover what has been wrecking precious ships as there is a sea-monster or is it?
To do this they take up residence in a new house...  
I enjoy also.
Just boring standard little kids songs.  
Seems to be made well.
These supplies, provided by his supervisors, include requisition forms for ordering supplies (of course, these have no use in the wilderness), a crate of light bulbs (these also cannot be used without electricity), and a crates of food that consist only of asparagus.  
So now we have a Buzz Lightyear with two glued together and unmovable knees, and one unmovable ankle.
"The Second Star" - (1:03) Performed by T-Squad.
This twinkles up with my two-year-old who puts everything in his mouth bites everything the wheels managed to stay on them the parts came apart and it's the right size
It is nice that it is a stuffed animal instead of an action figure!  
So many aspects of the film that I overlooked years earlier have now caught my attention.
I love this movie very much!
Long awaited Blu Ray upgrade has its good and bad points.
What a great movie.
I compared this Blu - Ray edition side by side with the Platinum Special Edition.  
UPDATE: It has lasted for 3.5 months which is pretty good considering the material and the number of use.
Additionally, the film is riddled with all of Pixar's trademark (clean) humor and wit.
The Touchstone DVD is, frankly, one of the worst transfers you'll ever see.
a great gift for a kid who loves the Brave movie.  note that there are many small parts, such as Merida's shoes, bow, arrows and quiver.  
Super soft and plush, and very very huggable.
Good movie for children's entertainment.
Alice in Wonderland and Blu-ray, a match made in Heaven.  
"Finding Nemo" is not only one of Pixar's biggest movie hits, it's also one of their best films.
They are durable and easy to take places.  
Reviews for this film were positive enough to pass but not greatly, and it was not a giant hit at the box office.
Worst of all was the ending, which was abrupt and unsatisfying.  
As a kid I eagerly awaited each new Disney film.  
David Ogden Stiers is a marvelous narrator, by the way.
So if you are looking for something soft this is not it.  
The actions are the same from the characters but you want to see it again.  
Haven't seen this movie before, and found it absolutely wonderful.  
The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.
I didn't understand it
I think there's a part two I have to look out for it.
So imagine how eager Disneyphiles were for the new release, firmly believing they'll nail it this time and that the Diamond Edition would look more like the 1991 film than the 2002 one.
It's as if we are to understand that their loathsome appearance is itself humorous.
It stars Keenan Ivory Wayans, Jada Pinkett, Charles S. Dutton,Salli Richardson.
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter as a birthday gift.
The only part that scared her were the ones where Ursula was acting crazy.
This is not a film about life lessons or personal growth.
Pinocchio ranks second on my list of personal favorite Disney feature animations behind Peter Pan and it's one of those stories that will forever be indelibly associated with the world famous studio.
One final note, this is the last movie that José Carioca stars in.
His Mickey Mouse Fire Engine play set is another big favorite.
This is another family favorite.
but it is a VHS - not sure how long I will have machines to show it!
The "hell" to which Jack is condemned, where he must try to work with identical copies of himself, reminds us all to be careful about what we wish for!  
(I did a fantastic kissing
The Silver Falcon:  Matt disappears following a lead to the Illuminati.  
She had out grown the infant tub, but because she wouldn't sit up I couldn't just put her in the tub, this was a great solution.
"Calender Girls" is not only based on 'real' events in a 'real' town in Englandit also presents fabulous entertainment from beginning to endEach of the characters, in this woman church group, brings their ownstory, terrificly acted, to the life of the movie.
The Beast is also an enjoyable character for this love story.
Unfortunately for them a human girl child was able to follow Sully back through the door and that where the real adventure starts.
My daughter started zigzag puzzles when she was 1.5 yr old.
My daughter uses this every day at day care.  
Committed young fans of the first movie, such as my 7-year old daughter, will probably like this, but otherwise, it doesn't stand up to the first movie.
Price was great, these are super fun!
I just notice some quality issues.
All the ins and outs Escapades from all parts of the World through the Comical and Witty written Plots, with some of the most memorable Shows that we enjoyed again, very Entertaining TV watching specially for Children, and all for that Great Price!
This was perfect for them.
Men, beginning with Bulvine, volunteer for this hazardous trial.
This is a great DVD.
The video is pristine and the colors are vibrant.
"Radiator Springs," "Character Design," "Animation and Acting," "Real World Racing: Getting Geeky with the Details," "Hudson Hornet," "Graphics" and "Darrell Waltrip Museum Tour".
Even adults would enjoy seeing this again and again.
The final release of Wave 5 is another worthy release.
Melody Time is composed of seven shorts and your Master of Ceremonies for this movie is Buddy Clark.
In disc two the most important one is the Backstage Disney and you learn story behind Bambi.
But instead, the movie moves painfully slow and goes for the easy, cute laughs.  
Predictable outcome, but what Disney movies are anymore?
Walt Disney's movies enriched my childhood.  
Perhaps that's why we root for him despite his character defects.
So we got a replacement for him.
They are not soft and don't provide any warmth.  
All they did was bicker.
Temptation:  Brooklyn, out for a joy ride on a new custom-built motorcycle, gets into a bit of trouble, only to be saved by Demona.
With very little dialogue, just some gentle voice over, we trace his path with humor,tension, and sadness.
The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition.
Early Presentation Reel - (2:51) Don Hahn talks about a reel made in presenting to the crew of what they were trying to create before production began on the film.  
Based on the radio show and books by Douglas Adams in the 1970s.
He loves them.  
This and 1995's "Heat" are Michael Mann's two best films.
I love it.  
His site was in northern Kentucky.
Just keep those things in mind.
They were all CAMs
It includes both DVD and Blu-ray versions of the film.
What an all time great
This movie is dope.  
The crown is just junk,
My daughter pretends to vacuum while we vacuum.  
The amount of entertaining and vintage special features included in this release is impressive and the fact that even some of the original special features from the previous DVD release have been given HD treatment is awesome!If you are a big fan of this animated Disney classic, you can feel confident that you are going to get the best looking, best sounding, most complete (in terms of special features) version of the film as of this time on Blu-ray.  
I think she could compete with any Mission Impossible plot!
From the first scene on, I was entranced.
Camera Move Test -(2:06)
When we do let the kids watch TV, it's usually movies that we've pre-screened, so I was happy to find this one just as entertaining the second time around.
I was slightly surprised when my daughter got excited when she saw it.
Best movie ever!
A favorite for christmas chuckle
I picked the Disney Flynn and Rapunzel and Maximus up for my daughter for her 5th birthday last February directly off the Disney site and was not disappointed at all with Flynn!  
I love this movie, that is why we got it.
The good looking guys/girls get everything while the less appealing people, represented in this film by the beast, really don't.  
Sydney has completed her mission to recover her friend Will Tippin (Bradley Cooper) and destroy the Rombaldi artifact the Alliance hopes to use as a weapon of mass destruction.
A bit graphic in some spots, but an excellent film overall.  
A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY ITS NOT QUIT ALL I EXPECTED FROM THE PREVIEWS ITS A LIL SLOW
My grandson, who is four, loves it.
"The Insider" is effective when displaying those facts.  
My grandchildren can enjoy it now.
Kind regards,Disney Consumer RelationsTo get your replacement discs, contact Disney via phone or web: 800-723-4763 (U.S.), 888-877-2843 (Canada),
I had been waiting for quite some time for the remastering of Bambi and I was not disappointed.
First let me make it clear I grew up watching DuckTales & I love the series, but this DVD set is one of the worst sets of any film or TV show I've ever gotten!I was so excited to get the DVD set I just couldn't wait for it to arrive in my mail box & when it arrived I waited three days to make sure my schedule was clear so I could watch it
Sadly, Howard Ashman passed away just shy of the film's groundbreaking release, Beauty and the Beast would forever be remembered as his last film.
Especially as he's getting harder and harder to find.
We love these shows, very funny, cute, good one.
I'd love to find more puzzles of this size for her!
Introduction To Deleted Song by Don Hahn: "Human Again"4.
He's very big & cuddly!!
Good clean humor and lots of fun dogs throughout the movie.  
(In fact, when my shipment arrived, I was stunned at how little is really included.)
frog!)The tiaras, bracelets, and rings are made of plastic and were sturdier than they looked at first glance.  
They were a great hit.  
I would challenge fans of Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid to go back and watch those films again and compare them to Peter Pan which looks far better despite being almost 40 years their senior.

Oh, how I'd love to see that scenery (and Janet Munro) in high def!As to the movie, it's been discussed in other reviews.
I bought this for my 3 year old daughter who loves to sing thereal song from the movie.  
In many cases, Academy distinctions and other such honors are superfluous and do not mean anything; but in the case of Pinocchio, the music was simply that good.
There's tons of new video commentaries about the making of the film, which I'm deeply fascinated to know more about the animators, directors, etc...I also have to add this to my comment.
Aspect ratio is in it's original form.
After going to the Beast's castle and Belle's Enchanted Tales, we decided to update our old VHS copy of this movie.
Not a bad price.
I have always loved watching home improvement on tv when i was growing up.  
This doll is well made.
While it does teach some great life lessons and teaches not only the value of obedience, the curse of lying and the love a father has for his children, it is presented in a way that can be alarming to young ones.  
Now most of our blurays look the same and it's really boring.
And in 2013, the events featured on "The Insider" and what took place many years ago is still relevant.  
Well perhaps technology is changing this, or we need to give a lot of credit to the artists that re-did Nemo.  
However, I watched Tangled in 3D immediately before Nemo and Tangled is a definite 5/5 in 3D, and Nemo really does not compare.  
I have no burning urge to rewatch it.
I don't care how old you are...if you watched this show as a kid, it's still amazing!  
Neither the three year old nor I liked this.  
The opening action scenes are in "Singapore", although from its mountainous terrain it looks more like Guilin than flat old Singapore.
As for the included DVD, the DVD is presented in 5.1DEHT English and Spanish Language Tracks with English SDH and Spanish subtitles.
My daughter just emailed me that her new Disney Doc McStuffins is her favorite toy for Xmas.
However, I was pleasantly surprised that the 3D quality of Beauty and the Beast was much better than the Lion King.  
The song really gets to me each time.
A simple, beautiful end to a great movie.
Really pleased, and great service and delivery to make this a solid 5 Stars - Thanks!
This poignant tale of Belle and the Beast will be treasured for decades to come.
Meanwhile, Gaston, the local narcisistic bully has decided he will do anything to marry Belle ("In town there's only she/Who is beautiful as me/
As always w/ these flix, a very mixed bag.
A box is opened to discover a severed ring finger.
Both these extras are worth the price of the disk in and of itself, particularly for purists.  
I don't think I ever saw this in a theater, and I'm pretty sure I never saw it in color.
Finding the Story4.
I didn't understand the plot very well, partly because it seems everyone was plotting, and betraying, and lying, etc.
Calypso was developed very well, until the end when they basically just erase her off the script.#4.  
I'm an adult so obviously it was a bit small
I got it very quickly, and it was in good condition.
Stick to cotton--it's a more comfortable, breathable and absorbent fabric.  
TV Spot #1d.
My daughter flipped out when she saw him under the Christmas tree.
I haven't seen the 3D version since my TV can't handle 3D.
The purple top barely closes and the closure on the tail will rip open if you make your Barbie sit.
Many times the background was flat and the cardboard cutout syndrome is obvious regularly.
My biggest and highest praised criticism I give to this film is the musical score of Beauty and the Beast.
My granddaughter is 2 years old, so buying these Disney Classics is a good excuse for me to collect them all.
My daughter has a fancier princess dress that was much more expensive than these
It has so far.
Many great lines that you will find yourself quoting in normal conversation with your friends.
It was one of his favorites for a few months, but now he only likes the toys.
Then it got so funny, they just relaxed and squealed with delight through the rest.
While searching the web my son asked if he could buy it for her Birthday and she loved it.  
Ok where do i start....
I am now looking for other toys within the film.
The 13th Warrior was a major disappointment at all levels.
You would not have believed how much glitter was in the sink.  
It's more expensive, but worth it for a filmyou're likely to return to repeatedly.
not the best quality but lots of fun for kidsLove the trunk to keep it all in
Still, I thought the older art form was well-maintained, and the story relatively intact.  
Our two year old plays with them a lot and just loves them.  
The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies to keep you busy for a while.
The pieces are durable and she plays with them in the bath, lines them up on the table and plays out scenes from the movie, and even takes them out in the sandbox.  
It fits perfectly in our baby"s room.
The answer is "No."  
Was disappointed at the thought that someone could take something that is supposed to be fun and try to disingenuously profit from it.
The music was written by the team of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken, who also did Little Mermaid, and Little Shop of Horrors.  
It is very entertaining for children of all ages.
Children should dismiss the flat objects in a depth-field and love this film but adult viewers have come to expect more from 3D.MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different.
My grandchildren watch it now and I love to see it again with them
If you are in the mode for a comedy with a twist of action, this is your movie.
Disney movies are classics and are for all ages.
So I rented this recently through amazon instant video.
now I've this movie in my collection,devon & crystal never seen it,now getting it reviewed,5 star rating,2 thumbs way up.
The Palace Pets' tiaras have two tiny prongs that are inserted into matching little indentations on the PP's head to hold them securely in place, while allowing them to be easily removed.  
and I've never been a fan of talking cars
I find that a great concept.  
And of course, I was jealous of her gorgeous hair.
The biggest aftereffect is that it stimulates a child's imagination.
I did find a nice nook in baby's room to stash this in and after using it for about 2 months have only had to air it up once, and only a bit.
None of them cared much for this film.  
"I find it irritating for you to insist on how many words I should use!!!!"  
Without a doubt this is the best the Little Mermaid has ever looked or sounded.
the good thing it's easy to clean and takes no time at all the cook.
It becomes tedious very quickly and brings my overall rating down a star.
The story line is great and so is the movie!
She takes this doll everywhere, and I mean everywhere.  
Simply put, everything from the faintest blub blub blub to the most harrowing scene to the ebb and flow of Thomas Newman's pitch-perfect music sounds utterly fantastic.
He skyrockets to fame because of his charm and soon becomes the biggest winner the show ever had.  
i think it can be emotionally hard for smaller ones because like bambi and other classics before it, it deals with some hard issues.
They have SOOOO enjoyed this video til its almost WORN OUT!
She loves to read, and the townspeople find her beautiful, but strange.
My granddaughter loves these, now she has the complete set, we were looking for this one and found it here, great price and really nice toy very happy with the purchase.
It's our consistent failure to answer that correctly that has everything to do with the state in which we find ourselves.
My boys (2 and 4) LOVE this movie and get excited every time I put it on.
A documentary on the making of the film and interviews with cast and crew.  
Good wholesome show, a lot of crazy stunts that are so funny.
Theatrical TrailerPreview Trailer*
This effect is heightened by the dialogue.
It's a classic for children who love fairy tales.  
a disney classic that should be atop many lists for it's soundtrack, original liberties taken with tarzan's movements, and character interactions
I would not order this from this seller again, though the service was good and the refund was prompt.
He won't slap her so the mean bear gets her and they battle it out.
This was -- by far -- the best.
The one word I can think of to best describe this film is "balletic".  
I WAS going to get it here
I sat there for an hour, then turned it off.
He takes on so many extracurricular activities that he doesn't have time to work on his grades.
Nemo is the cutest and the laughs abound with Dory's dopey forgetfulness ( reminds me of me!)
I was able to get the Anna doll just like this from Disney store and I waited weeks and weeks to see if this would be available.
It is not a Ghibli Work 4 Star and trust me, i love me some Ghibli.
I then purchased this one and he works great and my kid loves it!
The pillow is ridiculously poor quality.
But the rest is fictional with a nod to the legend of Beowulf.
One of my all-time animated movies.
The bottom of it has a little section to inflate so that she is not sitting on a hard surface.
Pinocchio is one of the older Disney animation classics that they have restored to full Blu-Ray quality.
The special features includes music videos by Christy Romano(The voice of Kim Possible)and Jesse McCartney(from the Tinker Bell movies) as well as a bonus episode of Kim Possible, in where Ron meets with his ninja friend Yori.
Well, I couldn't wait and I am glad I didn't.  
My daughter (3yrs) LOVED this birthday gift.  
Special features include: Disney Intermission, intro by Diane Disney Miller, deleted scene, alternate ending, deleted songs, free storybook app download and more.
This is my opinion, obviously, but for those who love the extended version that's fine.
In this movie, the bullies are treated like heroes while Chicken Little has to struggle to get people to take him seriously.  
The Einstein Rockets were Christmas presents for my 2 and a half year old twin grand sons.
She was very pleased with it - and excited to have it as a starter for her re-do on the bathroom in their new home.  
Love that it has a curling iron, straightener, and hair dryer!  
Would not buy this again.
half the characters don't stand up or if they do they'll topple over if a cat walks into the room.
I bought this for my grandchildren as they loved watching mine.
I bought this for my son.  
I got it for my 3rd child.
So far, so good.
After seeing the most recent Muppet film it reminded me how much the Muppet Show was a part of my childhood.  
Strangely enough, "The Treasure of the Golden Suns" which started the series is not here.
The rivalry that develops between Max and Herman is just extraordinary.
Such beau-teesit's been done by others dontcha seeall for the sake of cre-a-ti-vi-tyyeah, Disney took license with the main stor-eeadded song and dance, and a touch of gleea lovely embellished for all to seethis movie will last for an e-ter-ni-teeso yeahyou-know-what?it's really O-K.It's all just a dream an-y-old-wayof the many many versions of this fine talehardly any of the a-dap-ta-tions failthey've all been done with narry a shred of maliceall in all it's in the spirit of our dear friend
Lambie seems well made, clean, and cuddly.
The worst Flintheart episode we’ll see (at least until Bubba shows up).  
The widescreen format only refers to the film as seen in "Disney View" option, which is an extra that adds an illustrated frame on either side of the original film.
Here's a list of the new stuff:"Part of Your World" Music Video Featuring Carly Rae Jepsen (HD, 3:39).
I did the same with Dumbo, when Disney kept postponing the Blu Ray release date and when, two years later, they finally did release domestically, I didn't even flinch.  
You'll not find a better movie that will make you both chuckle and think.
I bought this movie for my great granddaughter.
All of the Rangers except Dale are turned into zombies themselves, and he must save the day and the other Rangers.  
Treacherous ingrate Gaston stabs him in the side but the villain loses his balance and falls anyway.
As for the Blu-ray release, the Walt Disney stamp of approval of releasing these classic films in the best quality as possible continues with "Peter Pan: Diamond Edition", the film looks absolutely pristine in HD.  
Monsters, Inc. arrived on time as usual with Amazon and packed very carefully, My kids were very happy when they opened this package and got to see this movie, the oldest boy fell asleep at the movies when we took him, he was just a little toddler when this movie first came out.  
I LOVE this movie (still)!
Material a little too silky for my liking, but my 5 year old granddaughter loved it.  
As with most of the baby stuff I have with suction cups, I can't get them to stay on.
We'll have to wait and see :)
Vocal Heroes: The Voice Talent3.
The staff at CHOC requested this film to show to the kids when they are hospitalized.
Thank you so much.
My dad even liked watching it with me.  
This doll is very poor attempt to bring the movie character to life.
However, within the first 15 minutes the language was so bad that we turned it off and got rid of it.
It's on repeat in the house and there's no chance of getting bored of it.
I like the intermission (pause) feature so if you have to pause the movie other children will have something to keep their attention.
She loves them through so who the hell am I to impose my physics based standards.
IT WAS A OLDER MOVIE
Slide Show Galleryi.
Disney Song Selection* Audio Commentary* Deleted Song: The Pirate Song*
There's no business.
My favorite Missionary movie.
I thought that as the Dodger Mr.Wood needed to work on it quite a bit more, but he wasn't convincing but not awful, either.
We just bought this toy for our baby and it's hysterical.
I don't like this one.  
60th Anniversary Edition is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  
It's great for teaching kids about learning to do things for yourself, and that sometimes we need friends and family's help too.
This timeless Disney classic even made its way into my first grade class at one point and the harrowing scene where all the animals in the forest were trying to escape the forest fire set by the evil hunters eventually triggered a discussion about what usually starts forest fires in real life.  
MY GRANDCHILDREN HAVE THIS MOVIE AND I ENJOYED IT SO MUCH THAT I ORDERED FROM AMAZON FOR MY OWN ENJOYMENT!
my kids love this movie...
She is a very pretty, pretty doll and looks great on display.  
This one one of Pixar's best.
The figures are very well made and sturdy.
They have made another blasted sequel!!!
The only thing about woody that I don't like Is his hat does not stay on, not even slightly.
As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.
I think I love this more than my son does.
The doll actually arrived earlier then stated, so that was nice too.
It never gets old and we can't wait to watch it over and over again.
Purchased this for my now 13 month old a few months ago, it's the perfect tub to bath him once he out grew the baby tub
101 Dalmatians II is one of the best Disney animated favorites to watch out for.
I have to give my viewing synopsis, also.  
Bambi has one of the most powerful and imitated musical scores in the film industry.
I know I don't.
Considering my 3 yr old watched this movie 3 times within a 3 day rental of it-
I mean, there are very few films where I will stoop to singing along, and this is one of the few.
If you are not or your child ...this will not be a problem at all for you.  
I purchased this for my daughter and when she saw Jasmine her eyes lit up.  
Overall, though, "Monsters, Inc." is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy.  
My two year old was enamored and actually had a CARS party for her third birthday.  
Not "like new".
The price was worth the wand,
My family has seen this movie many times before, but we just felt like viewing it again. :)
GOOD PRODUCST AT GOOD COST.
The DVD arrived in good condition and was viewed within a few days.  
A definite favorite for kids too.
the vhs tape was excellent.it played under perfect condition and no mishaps.even played in 20-30 year old vhs vcr!
Bambi is raised by his mother and befriends various other forest animals such as Thumper the rabbit and Flower the skunk.
that was so interesting to watch when he was playing that giant guitar like his brother.
You just can't beat that!
And while I give kudos to Sam Rockwell for conveying Zaphod Beeblebrox's self-centered lunacy, where's Zaphod's most distinctive characteristic, his towering arrogance?
No way to drain without dumping water.
And this film would follow visuals full of color courtesy of Mary Blair and company.  
My favorite part: Barbosa yelling at them to "Just kiss already!"And
The plus factor.
That aside - a really nice dress-up-kit-in-a-box.  
He has learned his lesson on the consequences of becoming a star, but when Pleasure Island rolls around, he has yet another lesson to learn: while all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, all play and no work is more than enough for a boy to make a jackass of himself.
it has all the right elements of love, humor, and heart.
anyway all disney is good.
Buy this CD set, you WON'T regret it!
but I think is for the young people not kids.
There's a very interesting chat between the creators as they met up again after ten years.  
It's a fact that I was too young to appreciate this film on some levels, but the fact that it stayed with me is a testament to something else.
find for sell anywhere but found it at Amazon.com.
It also redefined the musical form of animated features for the first time since Snow White.
There was no assembly required which I loved.
It should be somthing you would consider for your library
At the risk of sounding like a movie critic, if The Incredibles and Toy Story are the cream of Pixar's crop, Cars gets a solid B!
The film is definitely deserving of new extras like retrospective pieces, new interviews with cast and crew, or a commentary with Mann.
Walt didn't like "Alice" according to Wikipedia anyway.
The quality could be better, but it isn't surprising for a costume product.  
I've actually seen worse Disney live-action catalog releases.
The toys are well-made.
The ages say 3+ but the tops were falling off the shoulders of our 3 year old who is 26 pounds.  
I am building a library of classic Disney movies to watch with my grandchildren.  
And the illusion of seeing new talent to win is part of the collective unconscious.
I will be exchanging it at Target tomorrow only because my daughter loves Doc McStuffins.  
For me personally, the restoration make The Lion King 3D look Like nothing.
My daughter loves Rapunzel and loves Pascal so she generally loves this toy.
Good deal for 2-disc set.
Kathryn Beaumont is perfection as Wendy, a potent mixture of authority and genuine care in her voice.  
scale is a major plus!
I love Martin Freeman and thought he was perfect in this movie.
The kids programming that is on their channels day in and day out are so canned that they hardly pay any attention.  
The common criticism the Disney sentimentalized his sources is largely wrong.
The Criterion Blu-ray offers a superb presentation.
They don't make cartoons like these anymore.
We like mind activities for children instead of television.
There is a 5.1 Dolby sound option that offers somewhat mixed results in the battle between modern sound-mixing techniques vs. 60 year old monaural masters.
A MUST HAVE.
My three year old daughter loves this puzzle.
Hope the mother as well as the little one agrees with me!
Here’s a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.28-32./1-5.  
I thought it was the batteries.  
It's better than Amazing--it's somewhere between Mesmerizing, Astonishing, Perfect, and Life-Changing.  
It does touch on racism through not judging people by how they look or where they come from, but some of this could go over children's heads.
I will def be buying more!
Disney has done much better with other characters.
Our granddaughter loves Lambie.
Upgrade:  The Pack receive genetic and technological upgrades to their bodies from Coyote and prove to be more than a match for Goliath, Elisa, Bronx and Hudson who are captured.  
My daughter loves it - partly because she liked Doc McStuffins and partly because she wants to be a doctor when she grows up.
Beauty and the Beast Performed by Jump 5
Just buy it, along with all the other ones in the series.  
It has a musty smell, and there is something on the dvd that appears to be maybe something left from sticky fingers.
Palace Pets make a great gift for any little princess!
The inhabitants of a Medieval Castle are protected from ruthless invaders by a mysterious race of powerful and noble creatures.
The bonding of people against a common enemy and the warrior lifestyle also enhance the study of the first great English epic.
And then she had to kiss him too and thus condemn him to death because that's just what happens to all the guys she decides to kiss.
(i probably should've mentioned that the films are dramatizations of episodes from the original incarnation of THE WONDERFUL WORLD OF DISNEY.
An entire season for less than 10 bucks?
Halsuitneun item is correct, but to protect the child head, I listen to the wind, if not go to the fire, the product seems to be more expensive compared to.
so it's amazing that the shark still hasn't eaten her).  
A wonderful Christmas movie for the whole family .Eloise  is adorable and when she makes up her mind to do something there is no stopping her.
Oh... she looks great.
Awesome Villian.... I would buy this doll over and over.
The Steel Clan is back, new and improved!  
LA VERDAD  TENIA MUCHAS ESPECTATIVAS CON ESTE BLU-RAY PENSE QUE
THE BONUS FEATURES:
("That's it?
I ordered this for my daughter for her 5th birthday.
The humor was very funny.  :)
We purchased this for traveling.
This is a really amazing movie.
And another thing, after looking at IGN's top 25 animated movie list, I don't really like remembering how it "saved" the studio anymore.
so my child isn't laying directly on the floor.
it's the shortened version for today's kids who can't sit still for the entirety of anything!That being said, if you really want the whole wonderful story, read Mark Twain's original books!!
Just a decoration not really a functional piece.
English for the Hearing Impairedb.
Dialogue and music is crisp and clear, the slight sounds of leaves, horse galloping, the leaves rustling, the Beast growling, the sound of flame flickering, pots and tea cups clinkering, these are all well-done.  
Hero For Hire:  After being fired by Scrooge, Launchpad is tricked by the Beagle Boys into performing a series of bank robberies disguised as movie scenes.  
So, I drew eyes on for him with a Sharpie marker.  
I watched Alias years ago (10+?) when it was a sitcom and then "lost" it somewhere in time.  
If you are looking for a good Disney/Pixar movie I would recommend UP or WALL-E. If you want to make sure it appeals to kids, go for Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, any of the Toy Storys or Monsters Inc
My three year old daughter loves it, and is able to put it on herself.
It just might have been a tad too calculated for its own good, and for the first time--the emotion seemed too manufactured.
He wants to watch it all the time and so does my youngest daughter.
This is my favorite Pixar movie.  
It washed up beautifully and is very soft.  
Charming as always, with adorable secondary characters and sappy romance deluxe!
"Brother Bear 2's" bonus material is made up of a featurette entitled "Behind the Music" and includes interviews with Producers Jim Ballantine and Susan Kirch, director Ben Gluck and other notable members of the sequel team.
Thank goodness you can still find them online.
Everyone has a favorite Disney film.
Now, both of my daughter's (3 and 8) are hooked on The Little Mermaid.  
However, Magica de Spell wants the harp for herself, and so does the harp's guardian: a five-story stone Minotaur.  
The scenery was breathtaking, as well.
Sir Gyro de Gearloose:  Gyro, tired of being looked upon as a "gadget man", invents a time machine and uses it to go back in time to the Middle Ages.  
He is easiler to cuddle than the regular Woody that has the string to pull to talk.
I don't have a Blu-ray player, but I might some day.
It arrived just a few days after I ordered it!
So be very careful it can be slippery
His hat comes off very easily which was fixed with industrial sticky back velcro from a hardware store.  
Lots of cars made into cartoon characters which was fun to pick out all the different cars.
It's the type of film that latches onto you and never lets go while you're more than willing to let it stay as long as it's willing to stick around.
We don't know what the outcome will be.
Sweet stories and lovable characters make it fun for children and everyone.
I finally saw this on Youtube, and there isn't much for me to say about it.  
Its been forever since I watched this show
These would be fine to play with if they are the only set you buy....and dont mind a small plastic set.
I have two issues these, one was due to the toy and one was due to amazons packing/shipping method.
It is a fun series that teaches kids about the medical profession in a fun way.  
These came to me very fast which I was happy about because I just love this show.
Stromboli is very literally a puppetmaster, and the movie expertly massages the creative possibilities for outright horror that exist within a story about a puppet who wants to be a flesh-and-blood boy.  
so it's easily portable.
It instantly trumped all other stuffed toys, especially since she's a Doc McStuffins fan.
Some have pointed out that the two fully-animated stories are from TV shows and that's the kind of quality you get which isn't terrible.
It's available everywhere -- at Disney Store, ToysRus, Walmart, Target and
This is a family classic...I grew up watching it and now my children are too... :)
My kids love it, my wife and I still adore and enjoy the film.  
Nice to be able to watch cartoons with him and not be completely bored.
The story is so good and very funny, but touching as well.  
I'd always thought the nose thing was ongoing, not just one short segment.
of course Amazon :)
Beautifully shot on location in Switzerland - Disney at its finest.  
I appreciate that Disney gave time for Belle and the Beast to bond, as it bothered me that many of the Disney princesses would fall in love right from the start, even without knowing anything about the prince.  
The kids who have seen the movie... loves them.
and I see it as anything but.
Pixar's real strength, all the way back to Luxo Junior, lies in bringing the character to life.
This is a great toy.  
Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care.
And Ducktales was funny, but I laugh more while watching the other ones.  
At the same time, she has trouble (at age 5) getting all all of the parts back in to change it back to Perry (the hat takes up more room inside).She has been playing with it for nearly 7 months, and it continues to hold up well.
My children liked this movie.  
The Disney Tangled Flynn Rider doll is well-made.
The game requires the 'princess' to guess which card matches the princess, or allows the 'princess' to act out the character and if guessed correctly, both the 'princesses' earn jewels - number of jewels to be decoded with a gem, to attach to their accessories.
It's soft and cuddly and made well.
I have watched this movie over and over again, and like the first one it was so funny, heartwarming and just the best.
On the surface it seems like a fluff film but it's so much more than that.
i have not seen this movie in years, and i just recently watched it.
Good to watch one time but probaly would not watch it again.
I was kind of disappointed that the blaster that he is holding doesn't actually shoot out foam balls like Zurg does in the movie
Very pleased with my purchase.
Kathryn Beaumont does a SPLENDID job at voicing Alice.
My wife loves this one as well.
Pooh's Grand Adventure brings back all that is special in a Winnie the Pooh story.  
For Christmas this year she is getting the doc doll and the medical case.
Who can resist Walt Disney's original movies?  
Regular CDs are 5" round.  
Overall, seems to be a good quality product that my 2 1/2 year old daugther really enjoys to play with.

Kim Possible: So The Drama is a 2005 Disney Channel made-for-tv movie that was intended to be the final episode.
The Black Cauldron4)
As if you can smell the hundreds of seeds on an actual strawberry.
Very funny because my younger niece pretended to be Sleeping Beauty by lying down on the carpet.  
I was optimistic.
While sitting in the tub he would turn around and look to see if the monkey face was there and then would burst into tears.  
Because the cake is too small.  
Mickey & the Beanstalk is a joy for young & old!
Also, if you have to, disobey your parents and run away from home if that's what it takes to be with your man.
and I can tell you it is superb.
I give it a solid recommendation!
"O.R they?"
And once the REAL aliens appear - the movie gets even better.
The Cat Returns10)
Without hesitation he said - you need to pay more so you can save more.
While just about every animation company puts out movies that take advantage of celebrity power to gain an audience Pixar is one of the few who has consistently been able to get the best performances from them, and cars is no different.
One of the many great strokes of genius is his dissolving a wall in a hotel room into a backyard where Jeffrey Weigand's (Russell Crowe at his understated best) children play.
It's true beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.
This dvd of TalsSpin vol 1 is fantastic to watch with the children or people of all ages.
The normal full price on this is only $19.50 (NOT $45) at the Disney Store.  
A great outsider view on the Viking/Norse culture.  
I saw this movie on the Disney channel and I just had to have it.  
Don't know what this is?
You addicted to the money, Jeffrey?
The figures tip over easy and the paint was poorly applied (for example, our Pete didn't come with eyeballs painted on him).  
I recommend buying the pajama set because changing the mermaid's clothes adds another way to play with this toy.  
As soon as they reach Never Land they are fired at by Captain Hook.
Certainly worth a watch.  
If you're looking to own Brother Bear, the Blu Ray is the way to go although there are few bonuses left out.
Lots of excitement and no garbage language or sex like so much of our contemporary junk.
Most of these tunes are warbled by songwriter Phil Collins (he even takes charge of singing You'll Be in My Heart, practically stampeding over poor Glenn Close in his haste to hog the limelight and steal the piece from her.....and she was doing a better job of it).  
I wanted something before I transitioned my 12 month son to the big tub.
Great for kids and kids at heart!
I guess I understand why, and I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, but I think it would've been fun if the girls could have put some real perfume in these bottles.
The funny thing is the oldest stuff on this set (Alice's Wonderland), looks  extremely good considering they were made in the 20's.
The bonus material is also very good, but there is a really irritating misstep in the menu.
On his way to Sidney, they will find all kinds of obstacles, including being engulfed by a whale, almost being stung by jellyfish, and of, course, as we can see in the movie's posters, surviving shark attacks.
Overall good movie, definitely sparks up some emotion!
Victor Garber is one of my favorite actors.
He is well made and a wonderful additon to the princess ball.
thanks for sending it so quickly.
I saw the film as a child and again recently when it was released on Blu-ray, and found that I had forgotten just how beautiful the story is.
Just to clarify, there are two different products and so you can see them in the pictures above!
Little does he realize that his best friend, Ford Prefect is not an ordinary human.
Dory is funny because she forgets everything except when they find out where Nemo is.
So glad this movie finally came back out of the vault.  
I couldn't believe it, a movie about raccoons!
Excellent film, with great clarity on this Blu-ray.  
That being said, I like it and have put him in my bedroom.
I hate when studios keep releasing newer versions of their movies.  
The opening season for what is possibly one of the best cartoon series created, any fan would want this and any fan of animation should check it out.
The Blu-ray quality does not disappoint!
They are very cute and seem well made - only time will tell of they hold up.  
Randal Kleiser(Grease) directs the film.
I just don't really have the understanding though for why a gorilla would take a human into her family
The film basically divides its time flashing between the two environments: Marlin's trek across the ocean to reach Sidney Harbor (with the aid of a forgetful regal tang named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) and a hippie aquatic turtle named Crush (voiced by director Andrew Stanton)) & Nemo's time in captivity, planning a great escape.
There is no drain though, which can be frustrating if you give the baby a bubble bath, but this is great!
My son is only 6 months old and has no problem sitting up in it as long as we only put a little bit of water.
Bottom line, not a bad video for helping teach our children the importance of giving of oneself to others.
PS: For those of you who're wondering the Beast's real name as the prince though it's never revealed in the film, it's Adam.  
You might want to keep the 2007 edition just in case.
Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers was one of my favorite cartoon series from when I was a kid.
When I saw this in a book, I was surprise that it was also on dvd.
Glad I could still find it on VHS for cheap, just disappointed that there's so much junk in there.  
my wife and I.  The delivery was prompt...
Don Karnage, the captain of the other dim witted Air Pirates, may be considered a somewhat evil man, but with his Ricky Ricardo-esque mannerisms, he still provides some comical relief in these episodes.
No more untucked sheets by his feet.  
Loved this show.  
One of the greatest cartoons ever.
That being said, my daughter loves them and I got an excellent price on amazon.
The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is rated PG for thematic elements, action and mild language.
I'm switching over to Blu-rays now because of the colors that are so bright.  
If you own a dachshund, then you have to see this.
My bathroom is also very small and I don't want to deflate this bath after every use, so I am loving the suction to hang it on the back wall of the shower.  
We had recently purchased a Minnie Mouse toddler bed set that I was rather unimpressed with since the sheets were very rough.
GFT, Amazon Reviewer
I have not heard from her as to whether she doesn't like it so that is a plus.
I highly recommend adding this one to your library if you don't have it already.
She is so much prettier in person.
The movie has an odd anti-capitalist cant to it, denigrating success in favor of a retreat into a kind of colorless anonymity.
I imagine we'll be playing it quite a bit.
DVD plays perfectly and will be an enjoyment ffor some time.
Seven more words are required for this review.
Brilliantly cast, directed, and scripted, additional remarkable performances include John-Rhys Davies, and a one Hector Elizondo.
If you don't have a kid, but luv great animated films...treat yourself to "Alice In Wonderland" anyway.
He's one of my favorite characters, and my son LOVES him.
It never gets old and we really enjoy it as a family!
I love to watch his shows and i was glad to see them again on DVD.
A duck-verse sounds like a funny nameDucktales is truly a hidden gem.
They didn't cut corners on the sets and locations.  
I absolutely loved this high-adventure story.
It is engaging right from the start with a great, fun story,  and interesting characters that keep your eyeballs glued to the TV.
This is a cute plush that I purchased for a 3 year old.
It was significantly cheaper then I have seen it other places which is always nice.
She got hooked on them after playing the Palace Pets' game on our iPad.
No two Gargoyles are exactly alike, when angered Gargoyle Eyes glow like Beacons, Gargoyles can not fly but they can Glide from high Places, once airborne they use updrafts and downdrafts to their advantage ...
The sound is excellent.
Characters show up with bruises, scrapes, and bloodstained arm bands after combat.
My preschooler loves them and they are holding up pretty well.  
Both me and my 6 years old daughter we loved this movie - although of course for different reasons.
It plays more like a feature-length documentary than a dvd commentary, is loaded with witty and interesting commentators and is something that I hope dozens of other bluray producers take to heart and attempt to recreate for future releases.
It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.
i was still memorized on how good this movie is.
There are some scary jumpy scenes but they are for the most part actually very funny.  
A classic move in a great package.
I am a sucker for nostalgia.
I thought the set was really affordable considering most of the licensed Disney figurine sets are always $40.  
We also miss bear in the big blue house and blues clues.
You really don't have this problem with deluxe doll that has one long hand that  you can pose anyway you want in very natural way without those darn joints that will stop working after a short while anyway and just hang like a lifeless limbs.
We all truly enjoyed this movie!  
This arrived on time and in great condition.
This is a wonderfully, lovable stuffed animal.
My VHS tapes are all starting to not play very well.  
In that short all of his smoking scenes are cut and if you want the uncut version then you has to buy the PAL version or region 2.
Great time playing with this toy, I'm really glad I decided to get it.
Somehowshe really like a Royal engagement.
For some reason this Tarzan even walks on all fours much of the time as apes do, an affectation that must have seemed amusing to the animators but just looks stupid.
I feel like I purchased rags.
As I say, perhaps improbable in the extreme, but if you buy the fact that fish can talk and understand human language, the rest is plausible.
Amazing how these Disney movies are still exciting and engaging, here all the characters are so well developed and rich.
The 3D on this disc was impressive although the picture itself wasn't always the sharpest I've seen on blu-ray or in 3D.
The 3D does display very nice on my LG TV screen.
The Pocahontas dolls are hard to find, so I was pleased with the price of this one.
Disc one features the 5 part episode that was a movie pilot that premiered on ABC back in Septmeber 1987 called "Treasure of the Golden Sun" which tell us how it all began.
Disney Studios saw some hard times in the "war years" resulting in some lesser know or well received titles to sustain the studio with these short subjects and war films for the military.
Anyway, the movie deserves more, and I think it's indicative of Disney/Touchstone's lack of care for their live action catalog titles.
But I was really surprised that Pixar included a scene that trivializes aboriginal culture (aboriginal in this case pacific islander).  
I'd like to throw it at the wall.
He's been wearing the headband everywhere.  
The characters are magical, funny and charming.  
This may not be considered a review,But I liked this movie so much....my only question is WHY ISN"T
And he did a very good job, as he did in most of his films.
THIS LITTLE MOVIE - SHE SAYS IT IS ONE OF HER MOTHERS FAVORITE MOVIES & IS ONE OF HERS TOO.  
Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.
[totally joking!]
I wish I could know how to contact Disney and let them know my feelings.  
I guess it was no Madagascar or Kung Fu Panda.  
Alice in Wonderland is middle-of-the-roadish, in that it tells a series of mini-stories which last only a short time, and are rather disconnected from one another.  
Because of that we recognize Alice's dilemma in a deep and fundamental way.
My daughter 7 months loves her bath time since birth and this was great for our Dominican Republic trip.
but it's a good addition to my library.
This was purchased at the request of my beloved grandchild.  
Good hearted movie and adorable under the sea characters.
Marlin discovers that he need not have worried about whether or not his offspring would like him; one does and it is quite enough.
But nonetheless, we enjoy them.
If your dolls don't have hands, you are good to go!  
My 1 1/2yr old  grandson loved getting Jake as a gift and sleeps with him each night,then drags him in to watch the show each morning!
The talking one with the lamb.
The son, who is an inventor of sorts, brings down a dragon with a catapult, then befriends said dragon.
However, the top that goes with the fins and the dress itself does not fit on any doll in our house.  
It's pink, girly and glittery unlike normal doc kits.  
I can not wait for her to open them up!
It's a great movie with great songs.
It is definetly a family movie and Pixar once more proves their excellence in pictures by using cars to tell fun, thoughtful, and real storytelling.
a present for my niecegreat item
It also had a new song in it.  
He is such a great actor.
Good purchase and there were many in there to take off and put back on many times over.  
The depth of color and detail in the Blu-ray version on a high definition television is LIKE WATCHING IT IN THE THEATER.
this performance is an absolute joy to experience.
I think this is the only set back to the film there's some prejudice there that I'm not happy with.
Fortunately, I also bought the Cinderella CD which I transferred to anMP3 player for her to use with it.  
This fine movie has been on my shelf for years.  
Much rather her watch this than that annoying yellow sponge on Nickelodeon!
They are just about the best in the business and what you see in this movie will impress even today.
The price and shipping was very reasonable!
Kids and adults can laugh at the jokes and pratfalls as Kermit and his gang put on a performance worthy of the best of the old entertainers, and sadly missing from entertainment today where shows regularly look to go too far in their search of a way to thrill the audience.
That's pretty much it for this Braveheart wannabe.
I really liked this because it has Mr. Smee.
In fact, they are a distraction.  
It is so fun to share what you enjoy with others!
It doesn't bother me at all that it doesn't look like the picture, I like the one I received much better, but I just feel like they should have a picture of what the potty looks like on here instead of something different.
You won't regret this modest rental price, or even better, buy it to watch again.
Overall, "Finding Nemo" deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors.  
She's going to love it!!  
We love the dress, cape, and bow & arrow.
Watch it, and smile.
Again, I thank Amazon for getting this Movie for my collection.
In this case, it appears he exterted the kind of control that, say, George Lucas did in Return of the Jedi.  
Being a true story, it rings with authenticity.
This Zurg matched in size to all the other Toy Story toys we've accumulated.
Its still a decent toy and it certainly does everything that the ad states, but for the size and price it would have been nice for it to have a bit more functionality.  
Not that it's a bad message.
Disney - please come out with something better!  
My daughter loves this.  
I got this one for the kid and it's really good.
He doesn't cuddle things.
You almost feel like you're in the world of Monsters Inc.  
This is an adorable movie.  
Westerns from my childhood are near and dear to my heart.  
I also noticed that you do have to have some familiarity with the Disney Princess movies for a few of the cards that you are playing in the game itself.
Fun to watch even for adults, and great music too!
Everything is clear, but the track is front-heavy.
Exactly as I recalled, and my kids love it.
The movie is incredible.
Loved this set!!!
I was excited to receive the 2 disc edition.
and it is a very good story about wolves and funny also
For an old show, that episode had good stuff...
But every baby's different.
Like Peter Pan... : I'm glad this movie was remastered , but I don't understand why there isn't a full screen option.
A witch is brought into their presence and "rolls the bones".
IT IS EASILY CARRIED
No good music, does anyone remember any character in this film?  
Audio Commentary (Special Edition Only)Sneak Peeks1.
pretty and compact, my granddaughter loves it and has all her dance gear in it.  
It went by too fast
The Goblin visits him and guides him to the Goblin formula and weapons.
its so sweet and loving and fun.
It is now my favorite movie and I have seen it many times.
So, they fill up the screen, taking away from the film itself.
In store only at this point.
I love this movie!
We must always remember where we have been.  
Breathtaking underwater visuals, fully developed characters, a warm father-son relationship, incredible action sequences (the jellyfish scene is amazing!), and so much humor.
My kids love it and it was a great price too.  
They even somehow captured that "show-is-over" feeling you get after a big arena event, the welcome of cool darkness and low playing radio after a big noisy show.  
The movie is beautiful and the 3D is great but there is more potential behind this 3D movie than is tapped.
But watching the growth of the characters in a story told in an unconventional setting is always fascinating, and the story ends on a gentle note of loving reassurance.
I bought this movie because I loved it as a child.
However, after my daughter decided to sit on it a few too many times we had to toss it.  
Disney has not failed :)
She does tend to slide all over in it if I out more than an inch or 2 of water in it, but tgat's realky all you need anyway.
I gave it this rating as it was great movie to watch.  
I bought this for my son even though secretly I prob bought for me because I am a huge Disney fam ever since I was a little girl but even my son enjoyed this movie very much
Just things happening which one might not call bad but others might and teaches children to be understand of how our actions can impact someone else.  
Very nice quality.
The Blu-ray's audio does a solid job.
but once I did she loved it and instantly took it downstairs to her doll house.
Other than than that we loved it.
All you dads out there, put on this movie and sit with your little girl, watch the movie and tell her how much you love her.
This was a great doll for a great price!
My granddaughter loves Nemo and finding a large, plush Nemo in a birthday package was a total hit.
that the film was based upon, and wasn't disappointed with that, either - even though the producers of the film took some differing "tracks" with the story line within the book - it still came out a superb film!!
This depends on the film.
If you haven't seen it yet, you should.  
The concept is that the monster world is powered by scream energy.  
Box comes with 3 dividers (but after a month and a lot of use, the box fell apart and had to be reglued with wood glue and clamps-- divider couldn't be salvaged)Cons*
Bambi a classic Walt Disney movie.  
They find an unlucky ally when Sydney's presumed dead former KGB agent mother, Irina Derevko (Lena Olin), turns herself in to the CIA offering to help.
Most of the cast are stereotypes.
He and his cat are fishing while his goldfish looks on placidly in her fish bowl.
It got to the point that I would try to watch each episode and find myself getting distracted with other things.
yes, since Elizabeth kissed him, Will dies!
At the theater, I think my mouth literally dropped open at this.  
I am just so annoyed that a brilliant film was largely left on the editing room floor.  
It's just a bear of a game to go through.
It's also one of those films that, once you get started watching it, you simply have to keep watching, no matter how many times you've seen it.
Great group of costars but very violent; Not for children; But great story about early Vikings and their battles in the north
The quality wasn't remastered, but I don't care.
Rapunzel is adorable and this comforter perfectly captures that adorableness.  
One of the best Disney Barbie dolls I've bought.
Chicken Little is a lot of fun and is almost the proto type for 'Tangled' in its tone and flippant style.
Bought this one and when I watched it there was digitizing towards the end.
The first and only hand animated film to be nominated for a best picture Academy Award, Beauty and the Beast is a major departure from the classic Disney formula, at least where the Disney Princesses are concerned.
JASMINE DOLL - 11" HIGH BARBIE SIZE, DISNEY, WITHOUT BRASH AND TIGERRating - * (one star)I am rating it one star as I think it might be an okay first doll if you want to buy cheap product keeping in mind that it wont' last..
Pretty face and delightful dress.  
Love Dori and the stuffed fish looks ORIGINAL from the Disney store.
Fun for the entire family including the kids & Grandkids.
I took a watercolor pencil in dark blue and drew in the lines, making it much better.
He doesn't use the monkey back support at all, so we might just remove it (it has a velcro on the back).This tub (like others similar to it) works great at transitioning from infant bath tubs.
A very good account of the situation with the Jewish people during WWII and German occupation of the Dutch.  
I laugh out loud every time I watch it and nearly cry each time as well.
After one or two plays, she knows everything.  
Thank you for doing such a great job!!
What can I say?
I was so excited to see how cheap it was to purchase.
It is really cute and I enjoy the music very much.
It forces you to think.
My daughter LOVES this!!
one of my favorite adorable shows, brings back a lot of memories, thank you so much for having it available to me.
He befriends another pupils father (played by Murray) and when he too falls for the teacher things start to go awry.
Not only one of the greatest animated films ever made (my money is still on `The Grave of the Fireflies' as the actual `best') but `Beauty and the Beast' has the added bonus of being one of the greatest musicals ever put to film.  
Van Doren, who didn't own a TV in '56, said he met Albert Freedman (Hank Azaria) through a mutual friend and it was Freedman's suggestion that he try out for a contestant spot.
And you made enough before you can get out and blow the whistle, right Jeffrey?
This movie is absolutely hilarious.  
I heard sounds in the film that I never knew were there.  
I just went out and bought this blu-ray last October when it was first released as a "Diamond Edition" blu-ray.  
We had seen the Planes movie a few months ago, and this is what he wanted me to get for him (he is 5, almost 6).
this is a good dvd.  
There are plenty of extra features included for "Brother Bear."
All the characters are here.  
My niece forced me to watch it and I loved it.
He captures all the bravado, hubris, good humor, pettiness, generosity and pure sense-of-fun that run chock-a-block through all teenage boys.
One scene [SPOILER], where Dirk first finds out that Herman and Rosemary are seeing each other[/SPOILER], is the only scene that stood out with the blur.
It's not Bolt!
Then I went online to see how many episodes were originally aired, and came across a review by a critic on another website.
